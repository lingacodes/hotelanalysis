1,Grand_Copthorne_Waterfront-Singapore,50,Date of stay: June 2021,"Hotel's Favourite GCW turned my QO into a Staycay/Vacay! What a wonderful experience trashing my initial thoughts of how to cope with being ""imprisoned"" all be it even at a 5 star hotel? The moment I arrived at 2+am on the 18th June was a breeze with courtesy received. Entering the room #2306 was a relief with spacious, very clean and well equipt with neccesities. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The view gave me the serenity needed for this situation as it faces the Singapore river and city view even Batam can be seen on a clear day. Very good wifi connection helps keep my sanity intact.  Most of all what was more stunning was the great guest oriented hotel personnel which truly was amazing and what guests always expected nomatter what the situation or reason to stay can be. I must humbly commend them for making mine a pleasantly memorable one...   To Jiun Lee and Cheryl from 'One Touch' for keeping me company with their friendly and sincerity I can feel just over our daily telephone conversations and I was very pleasantly surprised that them knowing I'm a BTS ARMY presented me with an encouragement greeting card with BTS poster print! Now that was AWESOME! Liya (hope I spelt it correctly) from the same department was enthusiastic when we spoke on my checking out day. To all of you, gamsahamidah...  To GCW Hotel Manager Mr Terence Ng, my sincere appreciation for taking good care of me in making my stay trouble and stress free. You have a great team! To Kelvin whom I met briefly at the lobby upon my departure I appreciate your courtesy. To everyone from housekeeping, in room dining, to Certis Cisco, the M.O.H., I thank you all very much from the bottom of my heart.

2,Grand_Copthorne_Waterfront-Singapore,50,Date of stay: October 2022,"Excellent hotel and staff‚Ä¶. This is our fourth stay at this hotel in the past 10 years and we are very happy to return again and again. Apart from a couple of really minor issues with the room and a failed poolside drinks order (only once), I cannot fault it. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, especially Shirley, Jennifer and Kenneth on the club level, 29th floor. The pool is nice but was much busier this year, we think because of the increased popularity of Formula One now. The food at Tempo was very good indeed and the bar staff very attentive and friendly. My only wish is that the bar would stay open later. The breakfast selection certainly caters for a wide range of cultures and was very good. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

We stayed for 2 nights from New Zealand to visit our new grand daughter and were incorrectly charged for 7 and now after numerous emails requesting they refund us for their mistake we have had to lodge a dispute with Amex to get our money back.We actually checked out at front counter and they said they would email our account and once we didn't receive  it checked our card on return to New Zealand . They were clearly short staffed as long queues at reception so someone has made a mistake at reception. Our room also smelled damp and of some chemical  and we so bad we had to request a room change as it was extremely pungent.

4,Grand_Copthorne_Waterfront-Singapore,10,Date of stay: October 2022,"Needs a refurb and a bar that stays open past 10. We stayed here for the F1 weekend and to visit our son in Singapore, as it was a busy weekend the choices of hotels was limited. We were allocated a room which smelled of damp and soon as we opened the door. Severe evidence on the corner wall and the lampshade in room 1465.  Even outside the room the hall carpet was smelly and obviously had some sort of leakage/ personal accident. We were quickly allocated another room 1210.  It is in need of a serious refurb, decoration and furniture was in poor condition, not sure why it wasn‚Äôt done during lockdown. It did have a great view though. During the F1 weekend, the bar closed 10-45 one night and 10 the next night, for a supposed international 5* hotel.  It was a joke. On the plus side the doormen for fabulous and very attentive. This is supposed to be a 5* hotel but was more like a 3*.  I do not recommend staying here. ‚Ä¶ Read more Date of stay: October 2022 Trip type: Travelled as a couple Room Tip: Stay somewhere nearer the MRT.

It was a delight to stay there - highly professional staff, great breakfast buffet in the Food Capital restaurant and very comfortable bed and pillows for a restful stop over.    The staff are super responsive to any queries you may have and are professional, warm and welcoming.  I'd especially like to mention Jennifer and Kenneth, the hosts in the Club Lounge who go over and above to help you enjoy your stay.   The Hotel is right on the river and there's plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes within easy walking distance to enjoy riverside dining, if you fancy going out.  Dinner at the Tempo restaurant at the Hotel is very good.  We enjoyed two meals there.

59,Grand_Copthorne_Waterfront-Singapore,40,Date of stay: August 2022,"Great value, excellent breakfast We picked the Grand Copthorne sight unseen through an internet site. The rate, including buffet breakfast, was the major selling point. This is an older hotel whose grandeur is a bit faded but it was an extremely clean, comfortable, and well serviced hotel. The breakfast buffet caters for all tastes and diets and is excellent value. The hotel staff are attentive, friendly and helpful. The position on the Singapore River is close to many good bars and eateries.  A small niggle was the lack of an adjacent MRT station but one is currently under construction just minutes away. We stayed for just under 2 weeks and enjoyed most facilities. Our bathroom was quite tired but adequate.

I finally decided to book a room at Grand Copthorne Waterfront for 4 days, and I have no regrets in choosing this hotel! Great, friendly and awesome team from the door men, housekeeping, front desk and concierge. Excellence service especially to Mr. Paul from the Concierge team who does extra mile in assisting me with all my inquiries regarding hotel services.

This time, I arrived earlier for check-in and did e-check-in. The waiting and processing was so much better - highly recommend anyone to do e-check in first.  For both staycations, I was wowed by the service of the staff at both the reception, as well as in the restaurant.   Tip: As the housekeeping staff are mainly migrant workers, it would help them to understand your needs better if you are able to speak their native language instead of English. However, they are very courteous and willing to help.  Room wise - decent size but decor is dated. As this property is pretty old, do expect some signs of aging in the room facilities.

We stayed at this hotel as we were moved from our original booking as they were now being used as a quarantine hotel. We were still excited to stay here to end our 14 day holiday as the pictures of the room looked good and it was 5*. Our negative experience started when we tried to check in. 45 minutes we had to wait while one person was on the desk trying to sort check in and manage guest complaints at a peak time. When we finally got to our room, we were overcome with disappointment. The smell, the decor, the old TV and the watermarked ceiling greeted us. Neither of us wanted to take our shoes off as the room felt dirty. I then spotted the note on the bed about being eco and changing the sheets.

The check-in was smooth. But that was where the good things came to a halt. The lobby has a dated looking light installation. The furniture in the lobby area need to be re-upholstered. There is an atm, money exchange, convenience store on-site, so that's helpful. The room was small and did not resemble the hotel website pics at all. The bathroom had mould in the sink and shower areas. The toiletries were sub-standard. To come back to my room after every outing felt like a punishment. The air-con system worked fine. The staff at the coffee shop and bar were helpful. Even with a long overdue renovation in the pipeline, for guests who had to stay in this hotel under such poor room conditions, I felt cheated.

Have previously stayed in a club room, so expectations may have been too high, as we just had a superior room this stay.  The main disappointment was the cleanliness. I don‚Äôt usually check detail but I lost the back off my earring and while searching the floor was not impressed with the amount of fluff and dirt. The staff were all helpful but I wouldn‚Äôt say outstanding, I found the breakfast items to be on the cold side, and with only 1 chef on the egg station it was easier to avoid the line. I must commend assistance with late departure. It was great to store luggage and be able to use the pool facilities to shower before our flight, Thankyou.

This is not to the standard of a 5 star hotel. The room was dark and a little dingy, the carpet faded and obvious patches to the wallpaper that looked amateurish. The airconditioner rattled (mentioned but not actioned) and the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor (again mentioned with a fix applied that did not resolve the problem).  The pool is fantastic along with the gym. Breakfast is a crowded affair but with quite a range of food items. At present, there is a 1.5km walk to the nearest MRT station but one is being built across the road.  If the rooms were renovated, I would return but I can just say I was disappointed with the deluxe room I booked.

Central location & an awesome location 2. Large rooms 3. Seemed like a large breakfast spread, though i never ate..  Cons: 1. Very poorly maintained. Despite housekeeping's intervention, the ac wouldn't cool the room - just barely. No matter how low you set it. 2. Too noisy. The opening and closing of doors kept me awake - the corridor amplifies the noise. 3. Understaffed totally - during check out, i was 8th in the line, and only 1 counter open.. and despite a repeated reminder.. it remained 1 counter.. The understaffing shows on the service - even the front office staff is grumpy.. 4. Bad service - still waiting for my bill via email, despite reassurances tnat it will happen by noon. 5.

As it was a Saturday and the rehearsal for National Day had just commenced, Danny even alerted us when the helicopter holding the National Flag flew past the window, so that we did not miss the amazing close-up view.  They always came back to check on us and ensure we have enough food and drinks.  Thank you to Danny, Kenneth and Shirley for spicing up our visit.

Room 811 has a very nice view overlooking Singapore River. Room is spacious with complete amenities.  Lobby area has artistic design and nice space and aesthetics for photo-taking and to unwind for drinks. Staff are friendly, but check in was a bit slow.  Bathroom area is nice and looks newly renovated, nicer than the room itself.  The only eyesore is the old tv with bad screen and sound. Probably need to replace that as it looks it is going to die out soon. Didn‚Äôt go well with the nice decor of the whole hotel.

It is our standard practice to sanitize and do a wipe-down whenever we check into any hotel, even pre-covid. Other than the obvious table surfaces, we were disgusted to find how dirty and dusty the other surfaces were (refer to attached photo) - including the leather headboard of the bed, shelves, chairs, handles, etc.   And then there is the apparent lack of resources (or simply a case of the hotel subbing out services to the cheapest service providers?).

The location is great, right on the riverfront with easy access to restaurants and bars. The staff were very friendly and professional. The food was good. Overall, the hotel and our room felt a bit tired and in need of an upgrade. I would have thought that they could have taken advantage of the last 2 years downtime to do some works, but it seems that nothing was done. If you're looking for a reasonable hotel in a good location, the Grand Copthorne is a fair choice.

High floor and with a view down to marina bay sands. Walking down the flod is perfect!  Most staff very nice and did try their best.  The hair and spa in the hotel is absolutely great!  You don‚Äôt need to go anywhere else, both massage, hair blow, haircut and keratine treatment was great. No rush and you are very well taken cared of.  Easy to order foodpanda or whatever you want if you want in dining.  Safe place and no smell of mold.  I would stay here again if I ever come back!  The pool and gym is a bit worn down.

260,Grand_Copthorne_Waterfront-Singapore,40,Date of stay: April 2022,"Our Getaway In general, we had a good staycation. It was worth paying for Club floor privileges. Service there was good. We truly appreciated the warm and personable service provided by Shirley, Club Manager and Danny,  Club Executive, who were both very attentive & consistently diligent and efficient while maintaining a very calm and assuring disposition. With business picking up, space maybe a constraint and it may become a challenge to service a larger group of guests.   The Food Capital cafe could not cater to the large breakfast crowd so there maybe a need for either having different seatings, or to provide more seating perhaps in another room (like some hotels which open up other function rooms).  There is a need for the services of porters. Read more Date of stay: April 2022 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Waited 45 minutes for our meals even though there was not a lot of guests at that point in time. One staff mentioned it was because it was Ala carte, another mentioned it was because of the chef, and the third mentioned it was because there was a lot of orders to handle. Was quite unhappy with the discrepancies but at least they tried to remedy it by providing complimentary dessert. Got to checked in but when we finally went up, workers were at the room we were assigned to fixing a hinge at the door.

While the check-in was slower due to COVID19, the hotel provided high tea to us while we were waiting. Unfortunately, our overall experience was ruined by an overcharge for our lunch bill. During checkout, the hotel staff assured us that our dining credits of $20 will be taken off the lunch expense of $45.20. But it was not done and we were overcharged by $20 on my credit card.

She politely attended to my picky first breakfast and made sure my subsequent meals over the week were catered carefully to my needs.

I arrived at 2.30pm, waited in line till 5pm for check-in, only to be told that my room was not ready. I only got the keys to my room at 6.45pm for a 1-night stay. It might be helpful to review the manual check-in process and ensure that rooms are prepared before the guests arrive as part of the usual SOP of a 5-star hotel. While the staff are friendly, and this is appreciated, there is no other form of compensation or refund offered to all the guests who waited hours for their rooms.

415,Royal_Plaza_on_Scotts-Singapore,20,Date of stay: September 2022,"Lost its Soul and Direction I have previously reviewed this hotel and gave it very high ratings. It had a great location, warm, friendly and helpful staff and was good value overall. All that has now gone, except for the location!  My wife and I recently spent a week in this hotel in a ""Premier King Double"" paying over USD 300/night. And whilst the hotel bills itself as 5-Star, and charged 5-Star prices, the services are NOT 5-Star - more like 3-Star. Specifically:  - The hotel has no concierge or porter servive. We arraived at 1AM after a delayed flight and had to get all our own luggage out of the airport taxi and to check-in and then our room by ourselves. -The telephone response time from Operator and Housekeeping is REALLY bad, we often had to call up to 5 times and over 5 minutes to get any answer -There are NO International pay TV channels on their TV system other than the Free channels such as France24, DW etc. But NO CNN, BBC, CNBC, Bloomberg etc.and NO movie channels or options. Most cahannels are Malaysian and Indonesian and not in English. NAme me another 5_start hotel anywhere with such poorofferings? -The rooms only get cleaned every two days. And when we enquired why we were told it was a ""Eco-friendly"" approach. Nice! Very convenient excuse but, frankly, wehn I stay in a 5-star hotel I expect my bed to be made up every day thanks!!! -The hotel is COLD (literally!). We switched off the AC in our room on arrival and it was still cold one week later when we checked out. The room is on a RFID system and as soon as you leave the room and remove your key card, the system reverts to ""dafault"" and the AC operates agin!! - The old warmth and charm of the staff is now entirely absent.  In summary, this hotel is charging 5-Start prices for inferior service. They seem to be marketing to mostly local Asian guests from Malaysia and Indonesia with a heavy Muslim influence, seen in many different ways, including Halal buffets breakfast, lunch and dinner. There's no problem with that as such, just that the feeling of the property is no longer 5-star either. The hotel management do not seem to understand what they trying to be and for whom. The overall impression is one of a hotel that is squeezing its margins to the maximum without concern for service standards (perhaps Asian gussts don't care or complain?)  Overall, we now rate this hotel very poorly and we will never stay there again, especially as there are many other choices in the same general location at similar prices providing better guest services. This is NOT a matter of cost but value for money and the general experience of the property and the stay. ‚Ä¶ Read more Date of stay: September 2022 Location Cleanliness Service Room Tip: Don't get a ""Car Park"" view.

I can honestly say it‚Äôll be my last.   When I arrived I was surprised the uncle who always welcomes us was not there.  There were no porters to help us with the luggages even.  It didn‚Äôt feel like going to a 5* hotel at all.   Over the years I do notice the choices at breakfast is shrinking.  Noodle soups, many choices for congee condiments, salad dressing, pastries and bread are the name a few that is no more.  It felt like going to a 1* breakfast buffet.  As for room cleanliness, I was quite upset that only when I arrived that the room is going to be clean every other day!  It was a hassle having to notify room service every day.  If I knew I would have gone to grand Hyatt which is just across the road.  Thank you for the last 17 years.

Staff were friendly as ever, and the free breakfast is much appreciated - although they could have changed the menu up a little bit. Understandably, service has slightly dropped due to the pandemic - we were told that our room would only be cleaned once every fortnight and that was not an issue for us.

Hotel surprised me with a slice of birthday cake,such a sweet gesture :) We arrived in our room kn the 8th floor and it was clean and quiet. Perfect for those who wants a good rest. Very cosy  Room size is okay,but i find that the room service menu was not very extensive but its okay as we're in Orchard Rd,plenty of food options to go to/get delivery from. Bathrooms have bidet,and they included basic toiletries too.  We went fr the buffet breakfast at Carousel. Not much variety but the food was warm & delicious nonetheless.  Take note that they have a no-visitor policy just in case some of you want to have friends over.

Prior to check-in, I've made a call to the hotel to enquire if my booking went through as I didn't receive an immediate confirmation email (in fact until today, I still have not received a confirmation email or invoice) and to make queries on a special request. I was taken aback at the rude and patronising tone from the operator that served me during the call and could clearly remember her telling me that ""the hotel does not entertain such requests anymore"" and tried to shut me down by telling me that if I wanted to request for an early check-in, I would have to check out earlier the next day to compensate for the time.

Despite charging rates which were not too dissimilar to other ""luxury"" hotels in the vicinity, there was a complete disconnect in the services provided to guests as follows:  1) There wasn't anyone to assist with our luggage upon disembarkation from our vehicle at the hotel lobby.

It reminds me of the Sheratons in the US, which is okay but it's not a five start hotel by US standards. First, they were late for house cleaning one day and didn't come until 3 p.m. because they were busy. Also, my view was of an apartment building where I saw laundry hanging - I had no privacy so had to keep my curtains closed. They're close to the MRT but it's still 1/3 of a mil to get to the actual entrance to the MRT. And it's super hot there so that's kind of a bigger deal than you might think. If you want to cross the street, it's a big deal - you'll need to go underground and figure out how to get across in the maze. It's okay if you have a lot of time.

The first impression of the Hotel was good. Very good in fact. But the first evening, when we visited the Hotel's ""Premier Lounge"" we were really dissapointed. The Lounge was completely empty, and for a reason! There were only coffee and tea and some cookies and nuts. That's all! If you wanted anything to eat or drink, you had to buy it from the menu. Having paid a higher rate to get a larger room, have breaksfast included AND the access to the Hotel's Lounge, we really feel that this service was not up to the standards of any 4 or 5 Star Hotels in Singapore (or any other country). Breakfast buffet was served in the Restaurant at the lobby.

The S$198 price tag comes with breakfast for 2 at the highly acclaimed Carousel Cafe and also free access to the Premier Lounge so we thought it was quite a good deal. The location was great especially after a long day of shopping and dinner. We didn‚Äôt use the pool as it was small and boring. The premier lounge was a disappointment as there were only machine coffee, teabags, machine soft drinks, peanuts/potato chips and some biscuits. No finger food, alcohol or can drinks that you can bring back to your room. The room was small but ok, the aircon has a damp smell but we bear with it.

Check-in process is efficient even though there is big weekend crowd. Likewise, another long queue for breakfast over weekend, but the staff managed this crowd well.  For those with young children and especially thinking of staycation - the swimming pool size would be big disappointment. Also, there are NO KIDS CHANNELS on TV and NO other amenities like Children play-rooms etc.  Few other letdowns are the not-so-clean bedsheets, much-hyped 'free mini bar' that comes with 2 bottles of water and 2 small cups of juice, gym with half of the equipment under maintenance.

Firstly location of hotel is great, upon checking into our room we are quite happy with the amenities and that it is a smoke free hotel.   We visited the Premium Lounge on 15th floor and sad to say that it is far from premium experience. As compared to another hotel in Chinatown, their club lounge has better service, and light refreshment that makes the stay more comfortable.   We also visited its pool... the journey to the pool seems like a walk into time machine and you feel like ‚Ä¶ Read more Date of stay: February 2020 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

488,Royal_Plaza_on_Scotts-Singapore,50,Date of stay: February 2020,"Good pick for a 3 day stay in Singapore We wanted a good quality hotel located near the MRT and were pleased with our stay here. You can get the MRT from Changi to Orchard which is 200m from the hotel, or the 36 bus which drops off just around the corner, maybe 400m or a metered taxi which at 8pm cost us $s40 and the GRAB car back at 8pm cost $s22. Download the GRAB app before you go (just like UBER). Make sure you get a tourist travel card from the MRT ticket office as this is very cheap to use for your stay and the MRT and buses are very efficient. The staff were excellent, our room on the 3rd floor was comfortable, just a couple of comments - common to most hotels there is no drawer space so you live out of a suitcase. The listing sold a 'free mini bar' which is in fact just water - that needs to be changed.

There is a small iPhone sized box in each room that you set, then carry in your pocket which gives free internet access in Singapore wherever you travel. Reception staff set this up for me and I was good to go. Location is great, only a minute to the MRT and Orchard Rd with its plethora of shops and restaurants.

Pocket wifi (no need to buy local simcard)  Bad things: 1. Very ordinary breakfast. No changes in menu during my stays. Food taste so-so (only like Singapore soup) 2. Ask the staff to change bed sheet, but she didn't understand. So your staff didn't change the sheet. 3. Experienced annoying sounds at night and dawn.

We were toying with paying substantially more to stay at the Marina Bay Sands but glad we picked this instead. The rooms are a good size and quiet which was important for us and the location was just off Orchard road with a short walk to the MRT station. The taxi ride from the airport was 30 minutes and I downloaded the GRAB app so the cost was only $20. We didn‚Äôt end up using the pool or gym but both looked good for a city centre hotel.

We were very well received and shown to our room despite arriving very early in the morning (rooms are usually only available after 2 pm on day of arrival). Staff were polite and helpful. Rooms well appointed. Breakfast selection on the premium floors is limited, so we opted to have breakfast in the main dining hall on the ground floor. Because of the festive season the hotel was at capacity which created some congestion in the dining area. Food choice was excellent. Food quality was excellent.

We came back to it because of the pleasant memories we had in the past. However, our recent stay was disappointing. When we checked in, we were told in a stern tone by the check-in staff that we had not paid so they took a fairly large amount from our credit card. When we insisted that we had paid through our agent, we were told that the hotel is unaware of this. Later, we went back to sort this out and another staff asked to photocopy our itinerary and said that they will try to sort it out. All this with not even a friendly tone or reassuring smile.

They have changed how you can  help yourself at breakfast, normally you cook your toast and take the sachets of butter and spread to your table, but now you have to butter your bread at the toaster as the spreads are now in bowls not sachets. Of course this creates crowding and mess especially dragging a spoon of honey over a metre from the bowl it came from, and if you want strawberry you have to go to the waffle are to get a spoon load. And I like to have a banana for breakfast too but there was none, in fact whole pieces of fruit was very minimal but plenty of diced pieces were available.

Lately we have been choosing this hotel to stay on our trips to Singapore.   We love to stay in The Orchard Road area since it has almost everything.  However the hotels there are getting more and more expensive, while the rate of Royal Plaza on Scotts is still reasonable.  The hotel itself is located on Scotts Road, but it's just minutes walk away from Orchard Road and Orchard MRT.  It is very convenient even for people who have never been in Singapore before.  The room was spacious and very clean.  The minibar was free.  The staff were polite.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who are visiting Singapore.

Walk along the underpass which are connected to shopping malls at Orchard Road.  They have a good and quality buffet spread at the coffee house and HALAL!. They even have a drink counter just as you wait for your transportation. No hotels go to this extend to ensure you bring along bottle water for your travelling be it within Singapore for work or entertainment.   Watch out for their deco especially for this (2019) Christmas...It's a WHITE Christmas near the Royal Plaza entrance. Lots of people take photos because it's simply beautiful and just as good as you are in overseas during winter for Christmas.

Number one is neat and comfortable room with good internet connection and free mini bar. The only downside is the rather small shower area that I can barely move.

Number two is sumptuous and halal breakfast so I have plenty of choices and I can choose whatever foods I like without worrying about halal or not.

I would recommend for singles or couples, although there are other good options too. However they could not provide sleeping arrangements for our family despite emailing one month before, asking a simple request of king bed in one room and 2 singles in the connecting room. It meant we had to share 3 people in one bed and a single in the other. They do not have the ability to provide extra bedding, or split rooms (it is only both king or both twin bedding). They simply could have informed us of this before we got there and we could have made alternative arrangements. Instead they took our money and waited until we arrived to inform us of this issue.

We are a couple in our 60s and last year and this year we have stayed st Royal Plaza for three-four nights to break the journey home from Europe. Perhaps because we were repeat guests, we were upgraded to a nicer room without asking. The hotel is very busy with lots of conferences and weddings etc, which gave the lobby a real buzzy ambience.  And yet, in contrast, our room was absolutely quiet. The room was spacious and well-appointed. The aircon maintains the room‚Äôs temperature while you are out during the day. All the staff - reception, concierge and daily cleaning - were friendly and engaging.

701,Royal_Plaza_on_Scotts-Singapore,40,Date of stay: August 2019,"Business as usual !! This is my second time staying at this hotel centrally located nearby Ion @ Orchard Road. The reception team is efficiently okay as you would expect from any 5 star hotel. Room is clean, though the twin beds are rather small.  The swimming pool is quite small but swimmable. Breakfast choices are plenty and good, however, its coffee machines need to be upgraded... really!! Overall, I think this hotel is definitely suitable for business travelers.

Here is my experience. (1) Unlike other 5 star hotels there is no place other than your room to sit peacefully. because While entering into the hotel there is restaurant on left hand side which is open to guests and outsiders. I heard restaurant serves good food and probably that's why it was always crowded and noisy, people sitting outside in lobby etc. I have always seen 5 star hotels have plenty of space. but this one is like you better be in room. (2) Hotel says mini bar is complementary until you stay and realize thats its probably only 5 star hotel's min bar that has no food item like chips, chocolates or beers. All you get is 2-3 soft drink cans and small packs of juices.

Being a densely populated city-state facing land scarcity, many accommodation providers are designing properties with a smaller room size. The idea is that hoteliers are giving the guests everything they want and nothing they don‚Äôt need. As fewer items of furniture are necessary in a hotel room due to technology innovations, rooms can be smaller in size and still functional. In fact this is becoming a trend among the millennial travellers who appreciate such an atmosphere and yet stay affordably during their travels here.

But a hainanese place and other restaurants can be a great option instead. Read more Date of stay: May 2019 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Yes, Parc Sovereign Hotel - Albert St. is situated at just 280m to Little India District. For dining options, I would recommend visiting the following places:   1) Ananda Bhavan Vegetarian Restaurant - Established in 1924, this is the oldest vegetarian restaurant here in Singapore, with a deep heritage in Southern Indian cuisine that serves quality authentic Indian food.  2) Komala Villas - Opened in 1947 and now a household name in Singapore, this should be your go-to to sample some South Indian cuisine served on a banana leaf. Be spoilt for choice with its huge selection of Dosai when dining there.  3) Muthu's Curry - Since 1969, Muthu‚Äôs Curry has been serving their famous Fish Head Curry to the locals and overseas travellers. Don't miss sampling their award-winning Fish Head Curry, especially when the Red Snapper is in season.

882,Ibis_Styles_Singapore_Albert-Singapore,40,Date of stay: September 2018,Nice hotel on the edge of Little India I have stayed here a few times and find it to be one of the better budget hotels in this area. The rooms are clean and a little bit more spacious than the big chains around Singapore. The pool is great for cooling down on a hot day. Staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms have everything you need. The price is worth the extra 15 to 20 dollars compared to the big chains. 1 min walk to Rochor MRT and close to lots of shopping options.

We had their queen bed which is big enough for 2 Adt +1small child. Bathroom is  small though but  it's okay bec first of all, we are not after the bathroom.   For their breakfast, more on Indian foods, so we had just the vegetable fried rice,egg, and sausage on first day, next day we had their potato wedges and ham. They do also have bread and cereals and fruits.  Reading other reviews, some really complain with the breakfast. For us, we were okay with the foods we had been eating.   Anyway, breakfast is not complimentary so you can choose not to add upon booking and you can  order to their restaurant if you want to have breakfast or you can go buy at 7-Eleven attached to the hotel.

The biggest problem was trying to sleep.  On our numerous trips to Singapore we have usually slept with the air conditioner turned off (after cooling the room down) and just sleep with a top sheet, but as the room is so pokey it gets stuffy very quickly, and then there is no top sheet (not our custom or liking at all).

This means ""ramping up"" the air con which did not seem to have a thermostat so it ran continuously.

We recently had two, two night stays at this hotel before and after cruise out of Singapore. This hotel was part of advertised package we picked.  The location of the hotel is great. Close to MRT and to market shop at Buggi Street.  Reception staff were always helpful and generally smiling. The Superior Double room was a small shoe box. The bed for our first two night stay was far too firm. Felt like we were sleeping on boards!  There was lots of mildew in the bathroom. There were no face washers at all available. Floor had long dark hairs when we arrived.  Little room to put suitcases or to store clothes. There were only four hangers in very small cupboard but they would not hold trousers at all.

Helpful Share Response from GlobalPremiumHotels , Guest Relations Manager at ibis Styles Singapore Albert Responded 27 Mar 2017 Dear Anniversary_2013,  I am glad you had appreciated the convenience and ease of getting to the subway station from the hotel as well as having enjoyed your shopping at the nearby Bugis Street.  However, I am sorry you had found the bed too firm to your liking. Well, I have to highlight that bed firmness is very subjective and the bed comfort varies according to individual preferences. Additionally, I had noted your feedback concerning the bathroom condition as well as the housekeeping lapse. Having said, the Housekeeping Team shall be notified of these issues.  The breakfast service offered in the hotel restaurant comprised mainly of a local and Asian menu. While it is catered more to the Asian's palate, I would usually recommend travellers to sample local food whenever at a foreign country, as a way of enriching one's travel experience.

Rooms are clean, a bit small but the staff will move you around if there other rooms available, well priced in my opinion, nice swimming pool, the breakfast can improve a lot, definitely not a breakfast for westerns as it is Asian focused.

The coat hangers are designed solely for use in the room, i.e. they are non-removable and cannot be used if taken out of the property. In fact, most of the hotels here adopt this form of hanger design concept.  During your check in, you had been informed that your assigned room is located on the pool floor, which allows you to enjoy direct access to the swimming pool. It was only upon your feedback that you were relocated to stay on the 10th floor.  Concerning the travel advice offered by the Front Desk Staff, it was explained that you can travel using the subway from Bugis Station to Tanah Merah Station and then hop onto a bus to get to Changi Village, before boarding a ferry to get into Pulau Ubin. Regarding the travelling options to get to 1-Altitude, the Duty Staff had recommended taking a train. When queried on the taxi option, it was advised that the travelling time is about 10mins, given the destination is 2.9km away.

According to investigations conducted by the Hotel Duty Manager, the unidentified object is in fact not a needle and seems to be an attachment pin or part that measures no more than 2cm in length.  The duty Housekeeping Staff did not notice anything amiss when replacing the bed linen and performing the housekeeping duties in your room. Following the completion of the cleaning, a room inspection had been carried out by the Housekeeping Supervisor. As such, I have to conclude that the hotel had already performed its general duty by exercising care in keeping the room reasonably safe and protecting guests from foreseeable risks of injuries.

1125,Ibis_Styles_Singapore_Albert-Singapore,40,Date of stay: September 2016,"A decent hotel for a short stay in Singapore Located next to the famous electronics mall, SIM LIM SQUARE, this hotel is better known to the cabbies as Albert hotel (since it is located on Albert Street) as against another hotel of the same name located elsewhere but somewhere nearby.  Another landmark for the cabbies is the Village Hotel which is adjoining the Albert Street Parc Sovereign Hotel.  The basic rooms are pretty small in size for two people to open out their suitcases.  The housekeeping staff do a good job of keeping the premises quite clean and shining.  The breakfast buffet has not too much of a choice but adequate enough. If you feel energetic enough, a swimming pool is available on the 4th floor.  Check in time is only by 3pm - so if you arrive early, you will have to wait till the rooms are made available. ‚Ä¶ Read more Date of stay: September 2016 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Little India is 10 min walk from the hotel for Indian food overall a good budget hotel while on travel..

Helpful Share Response from GlobalPremiumHotels , Guest Relations Manager at ibis Styles Singapore Albert Responded 17 Apr 2016 Dear Adiasanke,  I am sorry to learn that the Twin Bed was not available during your stay at the hotel.  I have to clarify that the bed type requests are subject to the hotel's availability and such requests shall only be made known upon the guest's arrival at the hotel. The rationale is that bed type requests are very often subject to changes, even at the last minute, right up to the guests' arrival at the hotel. Scenarios include guests requesting last minute amendment bed type requests during their check in registration and rooms that had to be blocked for maintenance due to the occurrence of unforeseen room faults.  Generally, most hotels here and overseas adopt this mentioned practice, but of course hotels will try their best efforts in accommodating to such requests as much as possible.  Please accept my apology for the inconvenience for this matter.

1234,Mercure_Singapore_On_Stevens-Singapore,30,Date of stay: September 2022,"Great location and facilities but a few service issues took the shine off My first stay here (for 3 nights) started well with efficient check-in, and I was pleased with the room, being compact but well designed, very clean with a comfortable large bed (marked 'double', but to Australians it is Queen sized). The location is in an attractive neighbourhood within walking distance of Stevens metro station or Orchard Road, but I also found the buses which stop right outside very convenient for getting around, especially the 190 which went not only to Orchard Road but also to Clarke Quay/Chinatown. Having 2 pools shared between the Mercure and Novotel is great and I enjoyed relaxing here.   It seems they are still finding their feet after the covid-19 period, and there were a few let-downs. Firstly, the shower was not hot; this was attended to fairly promptly when I reported the problem, but even then needed to be run for a long while to get up to temperature; not exactly environmentally friendly wasting a lot of water unnecessarily. On day 2, I returned to find that when they'd serviced my room, they'd disposed of my personal toiletries (deodorant, aftershave, hair gel) as well as the hotel-provided shampoo/soap/toothbrush/toothpaste/slippers... I've never had this happen before at any hotel, and can only assume they got their wires crossed and assumed the room was to be made ready for a new guest, and only after they'd disposed of the items realised my clothes were hanging in the wardrobe and that I hadn't actually checked out! There was no welcome treat in the room for my Gold ALL loyalty, nor room upgrade (I do think the hotel was fairly heavily booked, so maybe not available). Upon asking, I was offered a late checkout on my final day, so that did make up for the other service failures somewhat. Finally, over a week later, I'm still waiting to receive my ALL points; it is annoying having to chase these up when other hotels are able to credit them promptly almost as soon as check-out has been completed.  I'd certainly consider staying here again, hopefully these issues are due to short-staffing and/or a large proportion of staff being new, and hopefully on future stays they will have all these sorted. ‚Ä¶ Read more Date of stay: September 2022 Value Service Sleep Quality This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

1235,Mercure_Singapore_On_Stevens-Singapore,20,Date of stay: September 2022,"The slowly decline of two once great hotels. I stayed several times in the Mercure and Novotel on Stevens. But it's not a good hotel anymore.  Check in was very chaotic. Rooms are still okay, but need to be looked after a bit better. Breakfast is ridiculous compared to what it once was. Very limited choice, mediocre quality, l would say choice cut by 50%. Really sad.  Biggest disappointment: they even do not have a lounge anymore that can be used by Accor Platinum members. What you get is a free drink at the bar, that's it. The main benefits are not available anymore: a good breakfast and having a lounge. The two pools are still nice, but I am not sure about hygiene.  Given the not really great location and the obvious slowly decline I will think twice before going there again.

Was issued a room situated at a high floor (2nd highest floor), but there wasn't much of a view as we were facing the condo across the road. The room was of decent size and basic amenities were provided - however the disposable slippers were left out so we had to request from the housekeeper separately. Toilet was also of decent size and relatively clean. Overall, had a pleasant sleep and will return if the price is good.

On the first day of check in, I was given a Q number but I keep on waiting and saw some guys just walk into the counter to check in and no one attended to the Q. Waited for an hour before I start asking ""how come my Q was not call, then someone just said you can go to the next counter"" if that's the case what's the point having Q number. And my room was not clean up for my entire stay, even the last night I called the reception/operator that I'm going out and please arrange a house keeping on my room, and that's was at 8pm. When I back at midnight, the house keeping tag still hanging outside the door and the room was not cleared. Imagine we use old towel for the 3 nights and rubbish bin totally full and smelly. As for breakfast, we only enjoy the day breakfast as there isn't crowd control, no one bother to give us a table as a lots of table were full of plates. I'm not sure why Singapore standard drop so much and as your sliver and loyal member this is the first time I had such experiences.

Walking distance to Orchard Road, comfortable rooms with enjoyable amenities.  Any hotel with an iron and ironing board is a win win for me!  Unsure about the halal ness of the hotel's buffet cause I didn't need to have it.

I booked for standard room in which it is good enough for one person. The hotel itself is just two years old. Pretty great facilities with all the necessary amenities. Situated just two stop from Orchard (if you are taking public buses) or you may rely on their shuttle in which it runs on hourly basis. The complimentary breakfast is pretty good. In conclusion, for standard room it is great for one or two persons max. However, if you are bringing kids, due to the room space you may need to consider Novotel on Stevens (literally just next building). I was also told that you can have your breakfast at Novotel with additional SGD 5++. They have more variety and there are also choice of freshly cooked foods.

I regret to learn that you were not fully satisfied with your recent stay with us.  Upon further investigation, as your check-out time requested was past the standard check-out time of 12 pm, our reservations team had offered a late check-out up until 6 pm that evening on 28th Dec. We understood that you would require the rooms until 11 pm on 28th Dec. As the rooms will be occupied up until 11 pm ( for at least for 11 hours after checkout), our reservation team had confirmed with you that checking out at 11 pm would result in a full day charge for that evening. With regards to the minibar items consumed, it seems that it has been acknowledged by your good self, as seen on the invoice.

Room is not entirely soundproof, I could hear what the neighbours are doing.   Bed is cozy but very small.   Location wise: a stone throw away from Orchard MRT. There's shuttle service from hotel to Orchard MRT. As place is also nestled in the residential area, you get the quiet ambience all around.   Cafe food and price at the lobby is overpriced.

Room size is a bit small, but bed is very comfortable. I could recommend to add conditioner and body lotion to amenities. Staff is friendly and ready to help. But, unfortunately, no one ask me to help with my suitcase, when I was going to the room after check in, overloaded with bags. Location a bit far from metro, but still not so far from the city center by grab. As for the breakfast, variety was great - european and asian options are available.

There is also a nearby bus stop that takes you to Orchard road if you can familiarize yourself with the bus routes. Nice gym and pool, breakfast was just average for Mercure standard.

Unfortunately the privilege lounge is located in Novotel which requires one to go down to the lobby and cross over. The same applies for the gym and swimming pool. Room is compact and clean, a compact bathroom attached.  The lounge is staffed with a group friendly service crew, but their evening cocktail service can get a little crowded around the small service area. Perhaps the format could be changed to individual portion hors d'ouevre instead so that everyone does not need to crowd around the counter.  Breakfast at the lounge features a decent spread of food and drink options and is much more calm than any of the restaurants.  Cocktails served at Novotel's bar are splendid.

We were surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a suite with premier lounge access and late check out. The staffs even went all out to have our room specially & beautifully decorated with balloons and pink petals for this special occasion and gave us an entire chocolate cake (delicious too!) and a bottle of red wine.

I just got back from Singapore (my first trip) and like many of my friends told me before I went there this country rocks! So I stayed at Mercure Singapore on Stevens road. Very nice, upscale location & quiet, away from the main downtown area. You must take taxis or local Grab (equivalent to Uber) actually Uber merged with Grab but that's for another review at another time. The hotel offers a free shuttle to town but not to the airport or from the airport. You must either take a taxi or arrange a Grab ride.  Mercure on Stevens is a very nice hotel, clean, staffs are very friendly & professionals. Check-in & check-out was handled quickly and efficiently at the front desk staffs.

There was a long armchair that I found to be the only place where I could open my large luggage without being on the middle of the floor. The bathroom also was very limited in space but the shower box was very fine. Internet was fast and easy to connect. The king size bed was very comfortable but covered with a extremely thick duvet.

The service upon arrival and for the duration of my staff was great.   The room itself was a Superior Double room which was adequate if not on the smaller side of things but it was clean and did the job. Little pet peeves of mine is when hotels use towels or linens with rips in them and my room had both on both nights (I assume my towel was washed/replaced). Just throw them out or repair them if it‚Äôs possible!   The hotel provides a free shuttle service to nearly sites which is extremely handy and I utilized this across both days.

However, this hotel also caters to tourists from China, and they appear in a swarm. Typically, they do not believe in standing in line, and often push their way in front of the queue. Disappointingly, the front desk staff merely ignore this action and serve them first.......until I kicked up a stink. I believe, this should be something Hotel management needs to address urgently, both from the queue barging guests and the front desk staff.

I stayed here because I got a very good deal through the Accor website - I paid about S$140.  I was only in Singapore for one night.    I arrived from the airport by taxi.

The lobby is simple and cleanly designed, with a cafe.  Check-in was fast and efficient.    My room was very small, but I was expecting this - it's a cheap hotel in Singapore.  It wasn't as small as similarly-priced rooms I've stayed at in other hotels: the Furama City Centre is the only place in that price range I've stayed at with a bigger room.

Next, was the shocker: the TINY room we entered. We had then to deal with a cramped toilet and shower area.

The staff are all super friendly and check-in was hassle-free.  Overall, I had a positive stay, although the room and bathroom are considered small for my liking. Some people have written that the MRT to the hotel is far, but I don't feel it that way - at most just 10 minutes lol.

There is only walking distance to the Orchard Road and the hotel offers also the shuttle bus to the city centre. The mutual space, like gym and swimming pools are spacious and impressive in contrast to the standard rooms, tiny and rather basic. The big advantage of this place is also pretty good choice of dinning options, oferring various cuisines and price level. However the breakfast served in the Winestone was rather dull, with limited choice of food. The staff, especially front desk team, is very helpful and attentive.

It offers the reasonable standard of comfort, but not luxury, that a Mercure usually does. A particularly appreciated feature is the sports facilities, shared by the two hotels. The gym is adequate in terms of size and availability of machines, while the pool is‚Äîunusually for many hotel pools‚Äîrectangular and long enough to swim laps. A drawback is the very small room size, which leaves inadequate space for suitcases, and a tiny bathroom with virtually no useable surface areas. There is also an issue in that anything involving interaction with the front desk will take an interminable amount of time and involve long queues. This was a constant frustration over several days.

The hotel is located in a small complex in a (posh) residential area, so it's relatively quiet. The complex has some dining options, we did not take the hotel breakfast because right outside the hotel lobby is a Pappa Rich restaurant which serves Malaysian cuisine including local breakfast :) It is located right next to the Novotel, which we have stayed in previously. The room was rather small compared to the Novotel next door, but functional with a minimalist aesthetic.

The buffet breakfast was excellent with choices of different cuisines including Indian.  The stay was super comfortable and I had visited for a conference in Singapore.  The only problem is if you arrive by early morning flight, they won't allow you to check-in before 2 pm which is definitely on the downside.

Very clean, nicely finished rooms in a new hotel. Perfect if you just want a place to sleep and it is also very reasonably priced for Singapore.

Make sure to get a bigger room if you want to work as there was no desk in the smaller room I booked. They also provide all the complementary toiletries you need if you are taking a quick trip and just want to travel with hand luggage, which is a nice touch. Food was decent. Good value and I would definitely stay here again. Read more Date of stay: October 2018 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The room was quite small but OK for my purposes. The staff were extremely helpful but their reception desk was always busy and a little on the slow side. Large breakfast options but not quite as good as other Asian hotels I have stayed at. It was nice to see Eggs benedict as an offering for the buffets but they think this is eggs with hollandaise sauce on a muffin, no ham though?? I would have though any executive chef would know this classic is made. Room service options are very limited and mostly western food, though their are half a dozen restaurants within the complex.

Breakfast at the restaurant downstairs is a mess: sorry but when they put the buffet food in corners where people are trying to walk it becomes clogged quickly.

1503,Mercure_Singapore_On_Stevens-Singapore,40,Date of stay: September 2018,"Enjoyed being here. Good functional room. As you would expect from a Mercure, basic but clean. Linked and shared facilities with Novotel next door. Great restaurants around. The pool was the highlight. It's the cleanest pool I've seen in 25yrs. Ie, I could see one end to the other underwater. It was about 40metres which was great to swim laps. Surrounded by greenery and towers, it felt like a private city escape. The gym was also large and well equipped.   The only flaw was it was easy to get into town from this hotel but not so easy to get back.

Also the staffs are pretty nice, and have the willingness to help us when we do ask for certain things during our stay. The only issue we had were variations in breakfast, size of the room, and a bit cramped when we sit on toilet bowl.Other than that, we are quite satisfied with the services and facilities provided.

Not too near to the MRT station but getting a taxi is not a problem there. Everything is good because the hotel is pretty new but the rooms are unexpectedly small. I think this is the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed throughout my countless trips in Singapore. People with bigger size might encounter problem in moving around the washroom. To be honest, I could get a bigger room in other hotels around downtown area at the same price. But overall it's still a great one despite needing to stay in such a small hotel room.

I book the room as it was the cheaper option and it was only for 1 night so I didn't want to spend more but the room was better than i thought. The GSO accommodated to my request to get a higher floor.   I knew the room was small even before i booked but it sort of felt spacious upon entering the room. Loved the bed as it was nice and soft and had a really good sleep with the curtains literally covering up all the sunlight.   The hotel had many food selection downstairs instead of having to order room service if you were lazy to head out.

Bed is comfortable - the most comfortable so far compared to all my other staycations in Singapore after comparing more than 8 hotels, room is very clean and nice, shower is good too. A great place to stay to relax and recharge after a busy week.  The Male Manager at the Reception during check-in is not particularly friendly during both occasions and does not smile and greet guests even when spoken to.  As a Senior staff working in the hospitality industry I find this rather inappropriate and unwelcoming and gives a negative impression to the image of the hotel.    The Junior staff at the reception showed more courtesy and was more welcoming and helpful when asked questions on room and availability.   Hospitality to guests needs improvement.

The front desk people were really friendly, and the operator was really responsive. The facilities were nice, we visited the pool and I will say it is really great. The room is rather small, as expected of many hotel rooms anywhere. However, they have all the things I will ever need for my stay. I like the layout of the room as well, as it looks extra cozy. The only two things i was not satisfied was the minibar and the bed. I didn't quite expect it to be that small as the description suggested queen bed. I understand the minibar in the room is meant to keep items in a cool temperature, but the very few items we put became warm instead.

As a Singaporean who lives in Melbourne now I rarely need to stay in a hotel as I usually stay with my son. In my recent trip to Singapore my daughter and her family were staying as well so I decided to stay in a hotel close by. The Mercure was an ideal 10 minute walk from my son and being an Accor member it was an obvious choice for me. As an original member of the old Pinetree Club it was nice to be staying in a hotel on the same site.  As I spent most of my time out of the hotel I didn't use the facilities but my room was very well maintained and cleaned daily. I appreciated fresh bottles of water everyday. The room was a little on the small side but again as I was alone and spending little time in the room it didn't bother me.

A good hotel that is part of the Mercure/Novotel complex that share the same facilities. You can't fault the service, food and surrounding restaurants. My biggest problem with this hotel is screaming noisy kids everywhere. Running through the corridors at 10pm, disrupting anyone who wants a little piece at the lap pool, it's kids kids and more kids. This may sound grumpy but you just can't get any quiet time here. The lap pool should be designated adults only otherwise what is the point of a lap pool when you can't actually do laps for kids messing about? Other minor irritation is a poor choice of breakfast cereal, rice crispies, chocolate rice crispies, cornflakes and bran. Where's the adult cereal like granola and muesli-standard in most hotels.

The hotel staff are welcoming, the rooms clean and Compact, however the bathroom is tiny and uncomfortable to move around in. The gym is great and the hotel also has a lap pool and tennis court. A free shuttle to Botanical Gardens and Orchid Street shopping area is provided which is necessary as it's not on a MRT link and in a quieter residential area. I've marked down my score as the in room dining is not good at all, limited option, no Singaporean dish on offer, the quality isn't good either.

Rooms are quite small but no smaller than what‚Äôs normal in Singapore.  For me the location was good as it‚Äôs a short bus ride to Orchard Road and there are good bus links to other places of interest as well. The bus stops are just outside and opposite the hotel. The nearest MRT (Stevens) is only about 7 minutes walk away also. They have free shuttle services that take you close to Orchard Road but the timing was never right for me.  The pool (shared with Novotel next door) looked great and I regret that I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it.

Located in a leafy suburb, it is an easy 10 minute walk to the Stevens MRT station, giving you convenient, cheap and efficient access to almost any other Singapore location.   The staff were very welcoming and the standard of service high.   The room is quite small (only marginally bigger then a typical cruise ship cabin!), but very clean and comfortable. If you've stayed at an Ibis Hotel, you'll have an idea of the room size. My guess is that the building was originally designed as an Ibis Hotel but, at sometime during construction, they decided to go more up-market and equip the rooms to the Mercure standard.

Firstly, I was given a room with disabled washroom facilities. This was inconvenient since it means you can't stand under the shower due to a bench fixed underneath it. It also means that water floods the entire bathroom floor for the rest of the evening.

1642,Hotel_Boss-Singapore9,10,Date of stay: August 2022,"Just awful Not only is the room tiny, but there isn't any cupboard storage, tea/coffee provisions or cups, cutlery etc. It is a bare bones room, just a bed and a bathroom. The bathroom exhaust fan cover had black mould growing on it. The bathroon is so cheaply put together it was falling to pieces. The bed was very hard, similar to sleeping on a  dining table. We could hear the rooftop air conditioner (on level 19/20) from the 16th floor. There isn't any soundproofing so you can hear everyone in the hallway. The breakfast buffet was awful.. the floor was very wet and sticky, the food wasn't edible and there is a sign that states 'there is a $5/100gms surcharge if you leave food on your plate'. Very hard to avoid when the food is awful.

And there are many places you can go, Sultan Mosque is just 6 mins walk, while mustafa centre is 10 mins,  we always walks around 10/11pm and we comes back at 2 am and you can feel that you are safe. The staff are nice.   We got 4 rooms cause we are 16 pax, it's just a shame that the family room is not on the same floor as the 3 rooms because they said that there is only one family room per floor.  What I don't like is that they only clean the rooms once a week (but i'm not reaaly that sure if it is once a week only) because we stayed there for 3 nights and 3 days we thought that everyday they will clean the rooms.

Tea and coffee were provided, but it wasn't the branded ones like nescafe/lipton.  What shocked me was they only schedule room cleaning every other day.

The rooms were very clean and they give you a towel and some shower amendments such as body wash and shampoo. If you want your towels changing you need to inform reception. The room was very small. The pool area was clean and had a nice view of the city. The gym was small and busy so was hard to get onto the machines.  The hotel is around 10 minutes walk from Haji Lane which is a nice area to drink and eat. The hotel will order you a taxi if needed. A taxi from the hotel is about 30 Singapore dollars.

Size of the room is so small that you will have to think twice, about where to unpack your bags. No cupboards, no press, no sleepers. and mind it, it is q 4 STAR hotel. On the first day, when we came back to the room in the evening, the room was not cleaned at all, even the bed and the bathroom was not cleaned. On asking, they told that we clean it every alternate day. When asked to get the clean cups for the room, the manager told us to wash the cups in the room and use it again. Never had such ugly experience in a 4 star hotel. I will request people never to book this hotel if you are staying for 2 days and are expecting a clean room during your stay.

We only had cereal to eat... we talked with the reception and we were moved to a supposedly more continental breakfast which had almost the same options... all the provided food was for asian breakfast.

Surprised that room was a bit smaller than expected as seen in the photos. But it was fine for just one person.

1693,Hotel_Boss-Singapore9,30,Date of stay: March 2021,"Very average The pros are location and view from balcony is wonderful. We‚Äôre on a high floor. Strong breeze and nice city skyline. Plenty of options around for food, both hawker and restaurants. The auntie in charge of room sanitation is friendly, helpful and quick when we asked for fresh pillow cases.   The cons are hairdryer doesn‚Äôt work, dated decor and furnishings, poor soundproofing, secondhand smoke from neighbours on the balcony. It‚Äôs a non smoking hotel but people flout the rules, which isn‚Äôt the hotel‚Äôs fault but dampens the experience. I can hear my neighbours quarrelling at night and loud traffic below. The mattress is not the most comfortable. Ordinary facilities. The central AC is in need of a deep cleanse.

Out of the 3 hotels, Mr Kar Heng left me the deepest impression in terms of service excellence. Professional and is sincere when attending to guests. There were others In suits which I assume hold a higher appointment than him but they should go to Kar Heng to learn a thing about service.  Room size is small and you get what you paid for. But cleanliness shouldn't be taken lightly. Hairs on the bed and toilet sink found upon check in.  Instead of only being the biggest mid tier hotel, try being the Best mid tier hotel instead.

Cleanliness is so so. Ants on dressing table, so can't put food there. Toilet has a kind of smell and no bidet! No toilet paper rolls, just small tissues. The balcony has no privacy as mine was facing to other rooms and no views. I like that there's smart tv in the room with you tube app as there'was just local channels to watch. Wifi was good.

The famous Arab street is just a short walk away. The lobby of the room was really nice but the rooms were really small. Check-in was a breeze but the front office could be a little more courteous.

The purpose of opening up staycation package post COVID19 clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities. Else, are we suppose to just rot in the room? Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area. Closing the facilities due to COVID19 measures shouldn't be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users.

As we were rushing for time, they managed to find one room available, allowing us to check in earlier than we should.   Through it all, they were always all smiles & friendly. Upon entering the room, Faizal even called up to our room to check on whether we‚Äôre ok & comfortable with the room given. We mentioned some tv issues & in less than 30mins he was up in our room to check & help us solve the issue.   I‚Äôd give his service a beyond exceptionally 5 stars service!

Good location, close to a corner shop for goodies for the room and close to metro too to get anywhere within the city. We did the hop on hop off bus tour where we explored most of the sights of the city so definately a good idea if you want to see everything. Probably cheaper booking online too although hotel price was only about ¬£7 difference. Overall good hotel at a reasonable rate Read more Date of stay: November 2019 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Rooms were compact and spotlessly clean and the staff were very attentive and very knowledgeable of Singapore.  The rooms had an amazing view of Singapore!  The only reason I did not give this top marks is the breakfast and breakfast area is not up to the high Singapore standards, I think when I stayed it was exceptionally busy so I will give the hotel the benefit  of the doubt on this occasion. Saying this I would stay here again as it is extremely good value for money all round.

Location wise this hotel is located at center place to various places such as little India, lavender MRT and other market.  The hotel staff is very prompt and does make sure that guest are treated nicely.   Hotel rooms are clean and if you include Indian breakfast then it is average, don't expect similar buffet which hotels in India offers to you but it is sufficient. So do go for it.

The hotel has a food court which has all sorts of cuisines at a very reasonable rate. Though rooms are small, it won't make much of a difference for tourists as the time they spend in room is going to be less. The beds were still spacious enough. We stayed in a triple room, which had a double bed and a single bed.Service by the staff was excellent. Check in and check out took just minutes. And the view from the room was simply breathtaking. We got a room with the view of Marina Bay. Would definitely recommend for stay.

We had very little interaction with the staff, but those we sought assistance from, were very helpful. The 18th floor room provided spectacular views of Singapore.

I like 4/F in particular because of its modern and stylish swimming pool and gym room! Lastly, I have to express my thanks to Kannika, my room attendant, who kept our room very clean and tidy!

The staff led by Hidayah demonstrates excellent customer service. The hotel is clean, popular and highly liveable with family.  The only issue is that room service folks does not fully understand English and sometimes it can be difficult to pass the message on.

We'd recommend using this as a base to sleep in while you do your Singapore tour. It's close to everything and would take you about 30 minutes max to any attraction you want to go to.  The rooms are quite small, even for 2 people and there is no storage for any of your luggage. So expect to live out of your suitcase. Even so, the room and bathroom were very clean.  Breakfast is decent - the usual continental and Indian selections were available.  Try to get a room on the Little India / Singapore Flyer side, as those have the best views.

Our room was actually larger than what we've seen in photos. And all the staff, esp the manager Hidayahh (who even wrote me and my wife a handwritten letter of welcome and has given us cookies!) are warm, very kind, and extremely accommodating.

The room was clean but very small and so is the bath room. For a couple I would say it‚Äôs ok to stay but along with a child you need to think a little bigger one... to the money spent I felt it‚Äôs quite good room for a couple.Space around bed is very small. Advantage part is it is very near to little India where a lot of options for Indian restaurants and shopping. Breakfast is reasonably good.

We were upgraded to a room with a spectacular view of the city from the 19th floor. The room was serviced daily, and although compact, was comfortable and clean. Breakfast daily, included in the price at time of booking, provided a variety of cuisine and topped up regularly - no excuse to go hungry here. You can also dine here for dinner if you desire. Tocha Bistro is only metres from the hotel lobby and has good daily deals on alcoholic drinks so you can certainly save a few dollars. Meals here are also worth trying. Our favourites being the steak and the salmon! There is also a  Gloria Jeans cafe in the lobby where you can sit and watch the people of the world go by!

So many eateries at ground floor. We do have Indian cuisines. Very clean hotel. Only issue was not many varieties at breakfast. Bus stations just attached to hotel. Superb view of the city. Felt as if I had booked hotel in MG Road of India. Though rooms are small, they are very clean. Memorable experience. The entire country was wonderful. Lot to learn from them. Visit to Chinatown for shopping.   My humble suggestion is to not visit Little India. You will forget the greatness of Singapore if you go there. Very untidy, they are very shaby,the environment is just opposite to other parts of Singapore.   Overall I had a great experience...
