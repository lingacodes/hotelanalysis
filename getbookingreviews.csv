0,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,‚Äú 2D1N for a family staycation ‚Äù,"I booked 2rooms , one of the room 1333 bathroom door was not secured on the bottom track. Was afraid that it will fall when we slide the door .  The chair beside the bed can see dust on it. Love the location . It near to everywhere u want to go. I booked deluxe king but was upgrade to premier king as i needed 2 rooms to be close to each other. Stayed in October 2022"
1,Royal Plaza on Scotts,9.0,"‚Äú excellent location, comfortable stay ‚Äù","slow room service. They don‚Äôt take calls after 8 pm easily if you call on landline. Best location, very clean, good veg food options in buffet. extremely comfortable stay. highly recommended and also for Indian vegetarian families Stayed in October 2022"
2,Royal Plaza on Scotts,9.0,‚Äú not much of a variety for breakfast ‚Äù,nothing near shopping areas Stayed in September 2022
3,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,‚Äú Was not as we remembered it in September 2017 when we last stayed there. ‚Äù,That there was no Executive Lounge anymore!  We booked on the basis that this still existed with afternoon tea and evening cocktails and were not told in advance that it had been discontinued. Location and housekeeping. Our room was always made up to a high standard each day. Stayed in October 2022
4,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,‚Äú just nice ‚Äù,nothing strategic location for shopping Stayed in September 2022
5,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,Very Good,"Near to Orchard Road - for shopping, food and MRT access. Easy connection to shops underground - good for rainy days - we did not get wet! Stayed in September 2022"
6,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,‚Äú satisfied and happy ‚Äù,"maybe the rooms need a little make over, they haven‚Äôt changed a lot since my last stay back in 2016 and I wouldn‚Äôt say that it is 5 star hotel maybe a really really good 4 star hotel. the staff was really friendly and helpful, messages were answered very quick and also my request for early check in and connected rooms were considered. I was so happy about it! the rooms were really clean and the location was perfect to explore Singapore! the mrt station was just a 5 min walk away and there were a lot (!!!) shopping malls and food places around the hotel. I would come back again :) Stayed in September 2022"
7,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,"‚Äú Very well located hotel in a very clean environment, which made us feel comfortable ‚Äù",Coffee machines at breakfast did not suit my taste Very clean rooms. Efficient lift service. The 11th floor looked better than the 10th floor where we stayed the previous week Stayed in September 2022
8,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,‚Äú We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and overall great value for money! ‚Äù,The warm breakfast choices could have been better. Staff do not upsell Singapore to tourists for some reason. They don't make recommendations for tourist attractions etc. neither do they give any local travel advice. Would suggest little more friendlier approach to customers as well. This does not only apply to the hotel but also to the taxi drivers. In most countries the taxi drivers love meeting tourists and conversing but in Singapore they just ask you for destination and at the end they give you the amount owing. Thats it! The room was clean and well serviced. The aircon was also very effective. Stayed in September 2022
9,Royal Plaza on Scotts,9.0,‚Äú Good choice. ‚Äù,"a bit noisy but it's at day time so it's ok, The hotel should manage check in and check out line because some people do not on the line when other waited to check. Location , comfy bed, service Stayed in September 2022"
10,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,‚Äú adequate if one doesn‚Äôt use hotel facilities ‚Äù,"difficult to get cabs. amenities in room inadequate. should clean room every day, not alternate days (for the rates charged!) location Stayed in September 2022"

14,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,,This review is hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
15,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,‚Äú it‚Äôs a good stay overall. ‚Äù,"there is no cleaning of room during our stays. i can appreciate that this is due to COVID restrictions but I think at least there should be method for the guest to clear the garbage from the room, everyday. location and the bed size Stayed in July 2022"
16,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,Good,The hotel only cleans your room every second day. For a hotel of this stature rooms should be cleaned every day and as early as possible for the guest's convenience. Stayed in August 2022

20,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,‚Äú Comfortable stay at good location! ‚Äù,"The breakfast closes at 10 am. We as family with young kids, would have preferred if the breakfast timing was until 11am or at least until 10.30. The spread was fine but needs more vegetarian options. Room service as well should have good vegetarian options or snacks or at least could be more accommodating with such requests. We had booked super twin room for our family of 4 (2 adults + 2 kids) but it seemed bit small for us so requested them to check if any better options available. They suggested the junior suite at additional cost which we checked and took up. The check-in and check-out process was very smooth. The suite was very comfortable. The staff was excellent- very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was fine. Stayed in August 2022"
21,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,‚Äú Value for money in terms of room and location but lacking in service. ‚Äù,"There was no readily available concierge or bell service to help guests bring their luggage up to the room. Also, we noticed that the rooms were not cleaned daily. This is something expected when we book a hotel. Stayed in August 2022"

28,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,‚Äú Will repeat if next time in Singapore ‚Äù,Early check in / small waiting area. Had booked 2 rooms and travelled for almost 24 hours and needed to crash in at least one of them approx 11-11.30 am. Would have been ok with even one of the 2. offered to pay extra.They did point us to the waiting area but that had only 4-5 chairs. May have been ok if there were more chairs in waiting are since its vastly empty Large room area as compared to Singapore standards. Good Location.

30,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,"‚Äú Great location, great breakfast, great comfort! ‚Äù","Some surfaces in the bathroom looked to be in need of repair.  Moreover, the WiFi login page would not work for me.  Granted, I am on a Linux Operating System and no doubt that is the reason.  However, I'm sure the hotel pays a company or service to set up and maintain the WiFi.  There's no good reason why that company can't ensure access even to Linux, and the hotel should demand it. I liked the room interior, the rooftop pool, and the breakfast.  Also, the location is excellent. Stayed in October 2022"

38,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,Good,I was only given 1 complimentary parking ticket per day. I was rejected when I asked for the 2nd ticket.

Not only did they rip me off here but also tried to charge me again for breakfast that I had already paid for inclusive and then fully denied my daughter entry to the kitchen without paying further after already paying again.

72,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,6.0,"‚Äú Good Location, Friendly Staff ‚Äù","The cost of the breakfast is crazy expensive and not worth it when you can walk into Orchard and eat for a fraction of the price and better food.We had some checkin issues that took a long time to fix and we were checked out after our first night and then needed to check back in which was annoying. This was bcoz we used booking.com to extend our stay and come one night earlier (pre done) but on their system it showed as two seperate bookings. The hotel gym is really good.The staff are pleasant.It is close to MRT and an easy walk into Orchard. Stayed in October 2022"

80,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,7.0,"‚Äú Good for a stop over, nothing flash, clean and tidy, good location ‚Äù","Coffee tea etc in rooms didn't refill and not enough thereof at any point. This was despite being requested twice, not a big issue but annoying.
Couldn't buy a coffee anywhere there, no team on.
Rooms are probably more ibis size than mercure so small in other words. 
Not all the facilities are back up to pre covid action so some of the attached restaurants etc not always open.
There is a 7-11 there that is constantly got a ""back in 30 minutes"" sign up which is bloody annoying but not the fault of mercure obviously.
Had to specifically request housekeeping towels etc to be changed for immuno comprised, and had to remind which is not good.
House keeping repeatedly turned off air con when we left it on purpose. (Also part of the immuno comprised thing) Then on last day removed the card altogether so couldn't turn it on and leave it on, this is very annoying.
The fridge in the room did not cool anything down at all and requests to have it fixed were ignored. Good location, friendly team, secure, easy to get to and from around the city. (use Grab app is my advice)
Pool and everything is as shown in photos etc.
Very good.

We are used to having at least 3-4 cups of tea daily and this quota system of giving only TWO sachets of Tea/ Coffee, 2 Sachets of sugar and 2 sachets of coffee mate creamer is not expected in a hotel of your standing.

Staff always available to help and got and did things instead of why they couldn't do them. Local bus service was good. Tour Big Bus company ran a good outfit in this city.

176,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,8.3,Very Good,"In the beginning, the layout of both novotel and mature hotels were quite confusing. After a few wrong turns, we managed to familiarize with the area. More entertainment can be introduced other than the usual swimming pool and gym. 
During the stay, it was raining heavily and there was no direct shelter to their restaurants. Hence, it was quite inconvenience for the guests and bound to get drenched. The service was very warm welcoming and pleasant. But the service is only at reception and premier lounge. However, the premier lounge was a great place to have the meals with the splendid view. 
Although the location of the hotel is near to orchard, it still provides tranquility of a rural area. It provides a peaceful environment to chill and get away from the busy lifestyle. Stayed in October 2019"

189,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,1.0,‚Äú Come on Mecure/Accor get your finger out and communicate/compensate properly. ‚Äù,"Check in system was not working when we arrived - it had already been out for most of the day. We had to HUNT the staff down to get any information. In the end we have to pin down staff by not allowing them to close the door that leads to the office behind reception and make sure that they could still see us waiting for them to come up with a solution and get them to take responsibility for THEIR problem and find us other suitable accommodation at no extra cost to us, which they did in the end, after around 4 hours of waiting.Still no apology or compensation for the wait and disruption after getting off a 14 hour flight from the UK and walking in to their shambles.We thought they would at least not expect us to pay for all of the stay due to the disruption - but no - they took their full money almost a week late. Possibly to help cover the cost of the failure in their system.Management need to go on some course to better themselves in how to look after their customers instead of hiding in the back room hoping it will go away - Communicate with those affected and they will be appreciated.

Not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel.
Rooms very good and clean but poor lighting. With all lights turned on the room was still half dark. Security and front desk staff very helpful. Good location. Stayed in April 2022"
249,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,Good,"Expected a better choice of breakfast spread, the choice given was very little and limited for a 5* hotel. TV channels were boring, could have given selective movie choices.

251,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,"‚Äú Struggling to see how 5 star standards, but excellent staff are the point of difference. ‚Äù","Breakfast poor given 5 stars hotel. For example, No fruit yoghurt, latte / cappuccino coffee. Also tried to charge for laundry, which had been included in the upgrade. Room good, if in need of refurbishment. Staff very helpful. Good on site facilities including gym and spa. Bar is a good set up. Stayed in April 2022"
252,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,Very Good,Some of the furniture was a little old and did not function very well such as the lamps. The TV was also outdated and did not have modern features like the other hotels such as screen casting option. The view from my room was amazing and the staff were friendly. The check in and check out process was very smooth. Stayed in April 2022
253,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,‚Äú A wonderful and relaxing stay. ‚Äù,"The room could use brighter lightings.  It's rather dim.  There's also not enough electrical outlet.  Would be nice if there's some beside the bed so that I can charge my phone while I am using it.   I also wish the cups in the room are much bigger too as I finished my coffee in a few sips and have to make again and again. Love the free upgrade by booking.com.   The room upgrade was a sightly bigger so all thumbs up.   The bathroom was big and the bathtub was good size, especially for a tall person.  I enjoyed soaking at the bathtub after a long day at work.  The room was quiet and sound proof.  I enjoyed relaxing on the bed watching tv and that's something you cannot take for granted as I will never get to relax myself if I am at home. Stayed in April 2022"
254,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.0,‚Äú Great location but hotel offerings were poor. ‚Äù,The room was drab and dull although i booked one of the more premium rooms. There was very inadequate lighting. Last time I stayed in the standard double and that felt much better in terms of quality and feel. Receptionist was rude and didnt give us a late check out even though there was availability. He said id have to pay and it wont be complimentary. I had the option of late checkout included in my room package. Breakfast options were very very limited. Location was good. Executive lounge staff was very warm and friendly. Great service over there. Stayed in March 2022

256,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.0,‚Äú It's the wrong place and wrong time ‚Äù,"Hotel facilities were NOT for 5 stars. Atleast 3 stars. We kept receiving emails to check in online with payment confirmation although stated to pay on arrival. Our credit card was charged 2x small amounts and was promised to be refunded but no follow-up!! Checked in also took so long, the 1st customer service had no idea what to do until the 2nd person helped him. Room are big and outdated, tv has no movies channel, only news about Russia n war or plenty local channel either in Chinese or indian languages which we don't understand. Breakfast food so standard no fresh food or fresh bread or croissants, stuff barely understood English there. We checked out a day early for emergency flight back to Perth as our pet sick then died not long after. We asked for refund for our last day stay which was promised to follow up with the manager but nothing happened instead still getting email and messages to advise the hotel our checked out time a day after we left to Perth. Don't think they're up to date with technology or guests details and information online. Not much to like as its far by foot or transport from the locals attractions, restaurants. Nearby restaurants were pricey for average indian small portions food. Stayed in April 2022"
257,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,‚Äú Fun staycation. Value for money. Would recommend. ‚Äù,"The check-in process could have been faster. Perhaps one more staff to oversee the process. I was waiting in line with just 2 guests ahead  of me but needed to wait 20mins. Room was large, the location was convenient to other attractions, and the room was clean and comfortable.. Room service was also prompt. The room is also value for money. Stayed in March 2022"

270,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,10,Exceptional,for breakfast i think maybe if all of you cooked all food halal is easy and much better for all people non-muslim or muslim can eating with confuse/not confidence. like me i'm just eating 1st day breakfast only after that no because my husband don't want.Sorry for what i'm saying just give suggestion to you.

276,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,9.0,"‚Äú Good sized, comfortable room. A bit off from the major attractions. ‚Äù","First of all the location might be an issue if you need to be close to the major attractions. For me it was not a bid deal since I like walking. In one sense, its distance to the major attractions was a plus in my case. What I didn't like was the separation of the breakfasts. There was a restaurant next to the infinity pool and also another one near the entrance. Even though they seemed to be serving the same buffet for some reason some guests were using the one close to the entrance and the others were allowed to the one next to the pool. I didn't like the idea to be turned from the door when I tried to enter the one next to the pool. We had our breakfast downstairs which was kind of more crowded... Singapore is not a very good destination when it comes to the accommodation. First of all it is very expensive if you look for a large room. Even decent sized rooms are very expensive. On the other hand Mercure Orchard offers a nice room with acceptable price. The tradeoff is the location. It is a bit off the major attractions. Even though the name is Orchard walking to Orchard street would take at least 15-20 minutes if you are fast! But the hotel is nice. I would stay there next time as well. The breakfast was good, the infinity pool was very relaxing after a long walking day. Stayed in December 2019"

Not worth the price asled.

In the second room, I had to clean the dust off the hangers before using them. These two incidents tell me the cleaning staff don't have a checklist to follow, and/or that no one is inspecting these rooms for cleanliness. It has to take a few days at least for dust to build up on the hangers.Internet connection is a little shaky. Modern hotel which is close to transportation links. Efficient check-in and check-out.

I didnt even bother to ask for a chance as i was about to check out in a few hours. Well i like the bed of course.

If there's a system to amend pool reservation and trace back earlier reservations that would be great. The location waa great.

They did not have hand towels or face washers which found very odd. Did call for towels & asked for face washers with the bath towels but was told they only have bath towels & floor towel. Towels could be softer. Breakfast was very basic, paid extra was not value for money as limited choices.

Booked the rooms under the wrong guest name through third party on Booking.com due to preset credit card details but the hotel staff made it difficult before sending email to the third party to help out. Stayed in May 2022
425,Royal Plaza on Scotts,5.0,‚Äú Breakfast was awful.  Room not cleaned daily ‚Äù,"The food at breakfast was horrible. They didn't even bother to change the menu and the taste of the food was not nice at all that my children refused to go down to eat and we had to take them to other cafes nearby throughout out stay in Singapore. Not value for money if you are taking a room with breakfast. Staff were generally not friendly. When we called to ask for house keeping service etc, they sounded so rude on the phone. The room was not cleaned on daily basis which pissed me off and I was not informed prior to my booking. This is unfair. No one informed during the check in either. When I called to ask for housekeeping service, they told me off over the phone that this is their practice that rooms are only cleaned every alternate day due to their covid policy to minimise contact. This is surely a mere excuse by the hotel as at the time of visiting, their staff and visitors mostly are fully vaccinated and they can also impose a rule whereby housekeeping only will be done not in the presence of the hotel guests in their rooms but this was not the case. Will not consider this hotel again. Location was perfect. Room was great with two double beds which were very comfortable. Stayed in May 2022"
426,Royal Plaza on Scotts,5.0,"‚Äú With the increase in hotel rate, would expect better services and room amenities. ‚Äù","Would expect someone to help to hail taxi to airport. Before Covid, there is always someone to help to get a taxi. But not now. Stayed in May 2022"
427,Royal Plaza on Scotts,10,‚Äú great location. ‚Äù,cannot get your own food at the breakfast buffet due to covid. great location right opposite ION shopping mall. beautiful decor in the lobby. nice breakfast buffet. Stayed in April 2022
428,Royal Plaza on Scotts,2.0,Very Poor,"Partial refund for the lack of services and pool closure. No service but charge is the same. No concierge no turn down service. Had to drag my own bags to the room. Drag them down to check out. No greeting. No room clean. Blame on covid but fully booked restaurant for breakfast with awful low quality food. Asked for bacon and given luncheon meat. Upgraded to premier room and paid extra for nothing. Pool was also closed. We booked the hotel because it had a pool.
It wasn't like this 8 years ago. Stayed in May 2022"
429,Royal Plaza on Scotts,5.0,‚Äú No lounge service ‚Äù,"I booked Executive Suites and lounge access was eligible as per the condition. However premier lounge is converted to co-working space, where there are only chairs. There is no magazine, soft drink, evening cocktail, staff etc. at all which comes as normal  lounge service. I asked if I can have soft drink at restaurant at least even there is no regular lounge but hotel staff refused it. When the hotel doesn't provide lounge service, it should not list in room condition as if it is available. I was really disappointed. Stayed in April 2022"
430,Royal Plaza on Scotts,10,‚Äú Fantastic stay for burthday celebration ‚Äù,"Room too near to near to main road, able to hear traffic zooming by when trying to rest. Toilet shower head holder was spoilt and room is too cold even when the room air con is switch off during the night when sleeping. Clean room, great services by the staffs there. Had the pleasure of being attended by Mr Dragon who was polite and professional in serving us. Staffs at Carousel also deserves to be mentioned by giving us a great service during our dinner there on 30th April. They were very busy given that buffets are opened up again on that day but they make every effort to attend to my requests. Food is fantastic there as well. Compliments to the chefs Stayed in May 2022"
431,Royal Plaza on Scotts,1.0,Very Poor,"Service is bad

447,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.0,‚Äú It was a pleasant stay overall. ‚Äù,"The breakfast spread was a little disappointing as I would have expected more choices. The Check In was slow. We had the deluxe room. There was a little smell and the room can do with some upgrading. The prompt response of the property and it's location. Near to town city and the accessibility from Robertson Quay to Boat Quay. Stayed in October 2019"
448,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.3,‚Äú 2 days Singapore ‚Äù,"This is definitely NOT a 5 star Hotel, We had for 2 nights 3 rooms, 
1st Room smelling like a smokers room,
2nd room, although it supposed to be a 2person room, only 1 bed side table, light-switches on 1 side only, bed unstable, if you move your partner will wake up due to the ‚Äúswinging‚Äù
3rd room, noisy as it was behind the elevators. 
All rooms the carpet was not really good cleaned. 
 
Bathroom nice, but.... neither in the bathtub nor shower a separate shower, so only from above or fill the tub. 
As said, for 3 or maybe 4 star a very good hotel, but definitely NOT a 5 star. 
We regret we booked it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Stayed in October 2019"
449,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.3,Pleasant,Noisy AC in room. Not many dining facilities. TV channels poor choice and poor quality TV signal. Relatively low cost Stayed in October 2019
450,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.1,Good,"Location is next to Robertson quay, but MRT and shops are not very close. Breakfast was below expectations. Service was slow. View from the room was good. There's an Avis below the hotel, which makes it convenient to rent a car. It's situated centrally. Stayed in October 2019"
451,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.9,‚Äú Could be better ‚Äù,"The service. A few examples, they got my name wrong at check in, we waited almost 2 hours for a Greek salad from room dine in service, took them a long time to send some bottled drinking water, just name a few. Also, no idea why but the room kept feeling quite warm even after adjusting the temperature to the lowest at 20 deg Celsius. The location is nice with a lot of nice bars and restaurants around it, very near to city centre as well. The room is quite sizable for Singapore and its clean. Stayed in October 2019"
452,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.5,‚Äú Reasonable good ‚Äù,Should give me upgrade bigger room with table so that I can do my work. May be future give me above 21st storey instead of 17 storey. Breakfast is good but only Siew mai was serve on 28 Oct 2019. Stayed in October 2019
453,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.5,‚Äú Average stay ‚Äù,"Room was very big just a pity the double bed isn‚Äôt extra big.  Should put sofa (2 seater) instead of 2 single seats cos more comfortable.  Swimming pool is boring. Bathroom was luxuriously big, though abit too plain.. can put some deco or greenery.  Gym was great.  Love the complimentary parking. Stayed in October 2019"
454,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.1,‚Äú Very comfortable and clean room ‚Äù,"The location is not really good. The room is comfortable and clean, the view itself also very nice. Will visit again Stayed in October 2019"
455,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,Very Good,The position right on the river was great and right next to loads of bars and restaurants. Stayed in October 2019
456,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,‚Äú Comfortable stay ‚Äù,"The staff worked incredibly hard at breakfast, but seemed very understaffed. This meant it was not really five star service. Tables were not laid and mugs ran out, for coffee, so disposable cups were used and plastic spoons for yoghurt. In a three star hotel in Bali, there were 4 times the staff for the same size area. Spacious, comfortable, clean rooms. Good buffet breakfast. Stayed in October 2019"
457,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.3,Very Good,The room was small and dated. For families it would be nice to have an option for a bath. Liked the breakfast. The pool area was nice. The location was great. Stayed in October 2019
458,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,9.0,Awesome,Th√© personal and breakfast. Expensive Nice view Stayed in October 2022
459,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,Fair,"There was a heavy moisture/humidity smell in the room. When I did ask for change of the room, I was told that rest of the rooms are the same and hotel hasn't been renovated for a while. Only solution I was offered, spraying odour remover in the room; i.e. temporary solution, which lasted a few hours. Long story short, it was an unpleasant 6-day-stay. Stayed in October 2022"
460,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,Very Poor,not as per rate Stayed in October 2022
461,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,4.0,‚Äú very very average hotel and not at all worth the money we paid for it! ‚Äù,"it was not clean enough‚Ä¶
staff was not friendly nothing much Stayed in October 2022"
462,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,10,‚Äú It was simply great overall ‚Äù,"This is not a criticism of the hotel but they did not have the booking on their system. However, showing them the details they agreed to honour our reservation. This is something Booking.Com needs to address. Got upgraded to a corner larger room. Breakfast was excellent and service was great. Easy to get around Singapore from the hotel and there was a nice river walk next to the hotel. Stayed in September 2022"
463,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,Very Poor,"This is really my bad dream hotel after coming back travelling.What I requested, they provided me opposite. For example, I requested high floor, they gave me the lowest floor for guest.I requested river view,they gave me swimming pool view. The reception and the electric man gosszip in Malay word about me. I asked 4 times room adapter by operator, they didn't care  . I had to go to the concierg countrer to take by myself and the guy with bold head talked with me very impolite. This hotel is not good for Asean guest. nothings Stayed in September 2022"
464,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,‚Äú Insect infestation ‚Äù,"I have a video of the remaining insects i could flush down the shower. Initially 25+ insects in the shower, I called reception and they said they would send an engineer to help but no one came. 
I complained the next morning but they were not concerned at all.
Seems like they have too many customers to rely on repeat visitors.
My room price also doubled when I asked to stay an extra night. 
Hotel is old and photos on booking.com are not accurate. Breakfast Stayed in September 2022"
465,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,4.0,‚Äú Well it was ok but I would not stay there again. ‚Äù,"The rooms have a very tired look and feel to them. the tree nights I stayed there I had no hot water coming and when I asked them to check into it they came back telling me that because my room was at the extreme end of the corridor the hot water cannot travel to my room. Although i was  frustrated and irritated with the whole situation, I found the reasoning hilarious ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the location is phenomenal. you step onto the promenade and you have a wide selection of bars and restaurants to choose from. Stayed in September 2022"
466,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,9.0,Awesome,There is nothing we didn't like. Hotel was pretty good and situated at good location. Breakfast was very good. Lots of option for vegetarian. Stayed in September 2022
467,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,Fair,"The hotel is totally over-rated! It's claimed to be 5 star, but I will give a 4 star the most. Very old hotel, the room I booked is quite shabby and run down. Really need a renovation! Location is ok, but unfortunately the closest MRT is not in operation üòï The breakfast has a good variety of food. Combination of western and eastern eateries! Stayed in September 2022"
468,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,4.0,‚Äú Pretending to be a 5 star hotel; really only 3 star. ‚Äù,Check in process was horrible. Not enough staff and chaotic. Our pre-notified early arrival time was not given due consideration. Room was very nice. Bath had a problem but not significant for us. Stayed in September 2022

You need to schedule your breakfast and I couldn't 'book' the time I wanted. In room services are very 4 star (no coffee machine, no glasses for water and bathroom amenities are like a poor travel lodge hotel ie small and mean). Despite filling in loads of pre arrival information including credit card info - they insist on doing it all again at check in, it took over 20 minutes to get my key. maintenance staff decided to work around the pool during may one visit, to erect new parasols, they were so load I left; I feel sure a real 5 star hotel would do this when there were no customers around! Hotel location is great - waterfront feature is good - staff are friendly - buffet arrangement gave good choice and good value for money.

561,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,‚Äú TERRIBLE STAY ! ‚Äù,"The receptionist was in a very bad mood and was not showing any patience or at least a fake welcome smile. He would not let me finish my questions and didn‚Äôt help at all. I felt VERY uncomfortable. 
I was assigned a room that I found out later is kinda close to the elevators area, and you have no idea how much noise those elevators make! it was a lot of work to have them changing my room and it turned out all the rooms next to the elevators get the noise at night. I can‚Äôt sleep with that huge sound; looks like a train. When they finally put me in a room far from the elevators, the room smelled mold. Again, the staff did not seem to care much.
I changed to another hotel in the area and it was the best decision ever: could not be happier. Not only that, but I made sure that our Company does not recommend this hotel to any of our 36.000 employees. the location is very good! Stayed in July 2022"

Additionally, there was limited comfortable seating in the Club Lounge although we were fortunate enough to secure same.Concierge services were poor - long waits for taxis and desk unattended at timesThe hotel was not cheap and we did not feel it offered value for money.Our very expensive room had a view of a building site which started work while we were still waking up.

623,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,3.0,‚Äú Pathetic Experience ‚Äù,"Don't know where to start, but let me try
- Overpriced given the quality of the facility
- horrible room cleaniness, dust on bed, bedside lamps, table, TV, hair on the bed, lobby carpet is dusty with dirt clogged into the carpet
Seems the hotel management only focused in extracting money rather than fixing the hotel. Yet hotel claims they need 4 hours to clean the room. Given the quality of the hotel cleaniness, it shows that the cleaner only spent 5 minute per room to clean
- Air-conditioning and electrical switches hanging
- hotel eating away 2 hours of time from standard check in and checkout timing. Now the timing are 3 pm checkin and 11 am checkout. 
Unfortunately I cannot attach all the pics and videos taken to this survey but given the unreasonable amount charged by the hotel, they do not deserve even 1 star. Pathetic and horrible experience Only location and free car park Stayed in June 2022"

697,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,‚Äú Disappointing. ‚Äù,"Arrived early at the hotel and requested an early checkin and was informed a charge of 80S$. I refused to pay this and requested if we could leave our baggage with them whilst we can stroll around the hotel.  We were informed it was not possible until we had our flaw test results. We stayed in room 1610.  Carpets in the room looked outdated and dirty. Bathroom floor and wardrobe shelfs were dusty.Disappointing to learn a five star hotel had not managed to keep up with the 5 star rating. Mini bar  and condiments were empty. Mini fridge was empty  and was told it was due to pandemic Next day at breakfast, I asked for a banana and was told they had run out.No alternatives was offered. Poor service. Went to reception for help to book tickets for the flower and cloud dome attraction. Paul very Kindly arranged this request and I made a payment with my Amex card. Cost was S 120.00 $. went on google to learn the combined  tickets was 80.00S$. once again I was extremely disappointed to learn that Paul did not advice me of this and booked two separate events costing me additional 40.00 S$. I requested Paul to cancel my tickets and rebook them at a cheaper  rate. I was informed by him that a refund can only be given at the venue. When we got to the venue I was informed that it will take 21 days to get my refund and I will receive a email accordingly. I was asked to pay again for the tickets which was 56.00 S$. All this was added uninvited hassle. On the 8th evening returning to our hotel room, we found unwashed coffee cups  and no replenish of water, tea or coffee.Dirty cloth along with dirty coffee cups were left in the bathroom sink. I called up the reception who agreed to replenish water bottles and some coffee. I was also informed  a day time duty manager will call me in the morning to take up with my complaint. This never happened. Overall it was a disappointing experience which was not expected on our  special 40th wedding annivesary. First impression of hotel was excellent. Check-in was smooth and was very quick.Kindly given an an early check in which we were very grateful .Lobby was clean and inviting. We stayed in room 1610. Views from the room was great. Staff at reception area was welcoming. Check out was quick. Again request for late check out was extended by 2 hours. Stayed in March 2022"

716,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,10,Exceptional,"Swimming pool is not what I expected in a 5 star hotel and Jacuzzi is quite small. The service. Nice and funny waitress in Tempo restaurant.
I received a letter from counter that I'm entitled to the club lounge, but in fact it's not, the counter made a mistake on it.
However, Ms. Shirley Chng (executive club manager) still welcome us to try the club lounge with FOC, which I'm very appreciate and it's a good experience . Megan did serve us very well, and the food is delicious.
Comfy and big room. Nice bathtub inside the room.

722,Hotel Boss,7.0,‚Äú Smaller room than expected ‚Äù,"The room was smaller than expected especially so for a family room. There was barely space even to put our luggage. 
There were mosquitoes in the balcony making it uncomfortable to sit and relax for an extended amount of time.
The absence of a childrens' pool was also very disappointing for families with younger children as the playground was also closed. The staff were very fast in responding when I asked for extra pillows and towels.

725,Hotel Boss,6.0,‚Äú Hotel Boss wasn't too bossy. ‚Äù,"Reception staff during check in was rather nonchalant.. Seemed as though he wasn't interested in doing the check in. Probably due to number of guests checking in was quite a number. Didn't feel welcomed.
For the price we got, the family room was kinda small compared to other similar rated hotels we stayed in.
Even though the room has a balcony.. But there's totally no view as the balcony was facing other rooms balconies..
We had to wait for more than 30 mins to just go to the swimming pool. Overall, it wasn't a memorable stay. Despite the setbacks of the stay, I do like the breakfast served and the restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.
The location was also very convenient with lots of food places we could go to. Stayed in December 2020"

I wanted to make payment but was asked to come and book when I check in the next day. I asked if it was possible and if there was availability since it was the weekends. I was assured there would be a room the next day. I was shocked to find out that there isnt a room and the staff simply didnt want to listen to my explanation. The duty manager in charge wasnt empathetic at all. He was more concerned of defending himseld instead of listening to me. Whats a duty manager for then?

770,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,10,‚Äú It was a last minute Staycay arrangement for myself and I choose Grand Copthorne waterfront. ‚Äù,"The layout of buffet in the coffee house for breakfast and Im more to the club lounge menu,simple and just nice for us Room is spacious and high floor as well with the great view. Stayed in December 2021"
771,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,‚Äú Flee far from this place ‚Äù,"We had an early check in on 15 Dec, left our luggages in the room and went out the entire day. When we returned to the room, the television was turned on and one of the luggages seemed to be have been moved. Feeling uncomfortable we went down to the front desk asking for a room change. The staff who attended to us flatly rejected our request for reasons being that 1) he had guaranteed that no one had entered the room and 2) he cited that there was no available room with a queen bed of the equivalent room rate that we had paid. Instead he offered twin beds for the night or queen beds only from the next day. As we were on a couple staycation, sleeping separately on twin beds wasn't what we wanted and so we were seemingly left with no choice but to sleep in discomfort for the night and to accept the room change from the next day. The thing was we checked online and found that there were rooms available with queen beds but of higher room rate (thought for a five star hotel ensuring the comfort/ safety of guest should have been of priority but seemingly does not appear so for Copthorne).
Claudia attended to us the next day and granted us a room change of the higher room rate as we narrated the episode that happened the previous night and informed of the faulty air condition in the room where the temperature was perpetually at 15¬∞C. Claudia had arranged for the bellman to shift our luggages to the new room and we went out the entire day. When we returned to our new room in the night, our luggages were nowhere to be found. We called the front desk inquiring on the whereabouts of our luggages and the staff explained that we would receive it in 30 min. Feeling tired after an entire day out and just wanting to wash up, we told the staff we would just pick up the luggages ourselves if it was going to take that long however the staff was unable to locate the luggages. After demanding that we receive our luggages ASAP, they found it and gave it to us in less than 10... Couldn't say I liked anything about our stay with Copthorne but I'd give credit to one staff (Claudia) the only person who did the right thing. Stayed in December 2021"
772,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,‚Äú Long check in process and disappointed ‚Äù,"Check in process, take 5hours from 3.30 to 8.30pm. Wasted 5hours doing nothing...management should look into the process and improve. overall hotel room is clean Stayed in December 2021"
773,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,3.0,"‚Äú Take it from me - coming from a 5 star hotel, this hotel is obviously not a 5 star. ‚Äù","So many things I am listing here.1) Waited 2 hours to check in despite being told I can check in at 2pm. In the end I checked in just after 4pm. I had to postpone my surprise for my husband because of the long wait. What bothers me is how long check in takes, and I am not sure if they are delaying it due to overbooking. Regardless, waiting numbers should have just been issued to guests while they sit and wait instead of making us stand for over 2 hours (I know people who waited more only to be told there were no more rooms).2) Our room was not made at all. No surprises for the poor service. 3) Our room was beside the lift and it was very noisy. I called to request for ear plugs and was told that she would call back when she got it. I called back and she told me to hold on. All the way till we slept, I never had that call back. Poor service.4) Pool was small, but it is what it is. 5) Breakfast was average. If you just want to fill your stomach, it would do. My scrambled eggs were dripping in liquid. 1) To be fair, Javin from Front Office upgraded a room for us which was big and comfortable. The view was overlooking the road, but getting a room was the most important. 2) Hotel gave complimentary cake because of our anniversary. 3) Hotel was flexible letting us in the pool if there were no shows. 4) Location was good too.

775,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,4.0,"‚Äú Avoid at all cost, 93-minute check-in, no room cleaning, fresh towels or toiletries, inedible food ‚Äù","Absolutely dreadful experience and the worst ever service level.  Check in took 93 minutes. The restaurant refused us entry despite arriving 20 minutes prior to published closing time. We were told that in-room dining was unavailable however after complaining to the duty manager it became miraculously available.  It took many calls to place an order for fish and chips ‚Äì what arrived was reheated, dry and inedible. The next day despite several reminders the room was not cleaned, no fresh towels, toiletries or drinking water were provided.  We order in room dining early.   When nothing was delivered, we called again only to be told that the kitchen was not responding and that they will chase them.  They never called back. We called again we were told that the items we ordered (steak and a cake) despite being on the menu were not available and that absolutely no cake or steak of any kind was available and that very few items were available.  Starving we had to go out in the rain buy food. We asked to speak with the general manager we were told that he is not reachable.  We asked to speak to the duty manager we were told he was busy. After insisting that we speak with him we were told he will call back.  He never did after many chasers he finally returned our call.  After describing our experience, he told us that the hotel is extremely short of staff and unable to cope with demand, that they are hiring more staff and training them.   When asking what he intended to do about the dreadful nonexistent service he had no answer but said he would report the matter to the general manager.  When I asked if I could speak with the general manger, I was told he is unavailable .  I asked if an appointment could be made for the next day or the day after I was told that this cannot be guaranteed but that a note with my request would be left for him Needless to say he never contacted us.  Incidentally calls to reception or switchboard took on average over 7 minutes to be answered. The only positive thing about this hotel is its reasonable location Stayed in December 2021"

Was called after an hour plus to join the queue to check in. Upon doing so and queuing for another hour, we were told our rooms werent ready. We will have to wait for another phone call to receive our room key cards. It was already about 5.30 to 6pm when we received our call to come down to collect 1 out of 3 room‚Äôs key card. Waited and waited again, went to the overcrowded lobby with long queues at 8pm where there wasnt any staff attending to the concierge.

We had to call and request for a late check out to compensate the time that was burnt which wasn‚Äôt even our fault and we only got 1 HOUR of late check out. We felt like we paid for 2days 2nights instead of 3 days two nights. The Hotel is nearby to almost any part of town from Marina Bay Sands to Orchad Road.

Stayed in December 2021
789,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,‚Äú Disappointing. ‚Äù,"1)The check in was a terrible experience. Queued for more than an hour despite making an appointment which was scheduled via email. When we asked the staff they said we still needed to Q. So whats the point of asking us to book an appointment for checking in. For a 5 star establishment, the hotel management should really look at improving this immediately. It was such a bad start to our stay. While queueing, we were told only 1 declaration form needed to be filled per room. BUT at the checkin counter we were told everyone needed to fill up the form. This could have been the reason for the longggg hold-up. Couldnt this be done online? 
2) During check-in we were told that both rooms have bathtubs, but turned out only 1 room had it. 
3)The room and toilet were dusty. We all had allergy reaction and kept sneeezing. Our sinuses acted up. 
4) And what is up with the room lighting?? I had to use my hp torchlight to look for items in my bag! So eerie and bad for our eyes!
5) The television needs upgrading. Quality was so low i had to resort watching from my phone instead. 
6) The aircon had a loud sound..as if a plane is taking off every 10mins. So hard to sleep. 
Basically, we think the hotel badly needs a total make-over/renovation. As of now we definitely will not be returning to the hotel. The hotel staff also looked tired and overworked. Location

So i went up to my room, and came down back to settle situation after i made my  calculation for the booking. Another staff named Kimi helped me with everything. So what happened was, Carol, mistook my name with another guest name, saying it was similar.(Said by a male staff). Both the male staff & Kimi apologise ON THE BEHALF OF CAROL instead. (Thank u soo much Kimi, atleast u have the heart to hear me out & checked my booking number and etc. Appreciate it much babe!!)

We were moved to another room but was a smoking room so absolutely stunk but it was either smell of fumes or suffer severe migraines from the construction work. The 'new room' was filthy. The remote looked liked it had boogers on it and the bathroom was filthy; I have pictures of this. Rooms were tired and old. Definitely NOT a 5* Location Stayed in November 2019"
865,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,9.6,Exceptional,Location was a bit out of the way Comfortable and clean Stayed in November 2019
866,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,Fair,"Check-in was painfully long. Myself and partner were ushered to one queue (position 2) waiting at reception.Numerous guests were ushered to 2 other queues3&  4 people deep .These people were  serviced efficiently and in a timely manor , we counted 6 check-ins behind us(in the other queues)  ,being processed before us !it took 15 mins to process the couple in front of us.. after 16 hours of travel it was unprofessional, and someone should have noticed and stepped in to manage the process fairly. I was informed at the  desk the pre-authorization on my credit card  would take 14 days to be credited back to me.this figure was twice the amount of the room price !! (still don't understand why it takes so long?) Between booking.com and the Copthorne, I had 3 payments taken from my card .1 X pre-auth, and 2 X booking charges for 1 night!. The room smelt musty and dated,on the presidential floor ,and my partner was convinced someone had smoked in there previously. We liked leaving. Stayed in November 2019"

877,Hotel Boss,7.0,Good,"No greeting at all from the moment I step into the hotel till i check out in the evening, not even a word good morning, thank u or enjoy your stay. Can see many Malaysian staff staying there as may cannot go back to their country. Are we being treated like that. Your receptionist is that worse i see from so many hotels should have more training. We were asked whether we would like to have breakfast there if so we have to pay at the reception first, then I told her that I don't know what are we having how to pay first? She said maybe you like to go up and have a look then come back and pay. So we when up to the 4th floor cafe and when in, but no menu was shown! Just asked whether we could have western or local breakfast. Also not told what we will be serving!!! üò° Then we were served our coffee and tea but it was not hot all just luke warm coffee and tea. After our breakfast then we thought we go to the reception and pay, your waitress chase after us and say we still have not pay for the breakfast then i told her the receptionist ask me to pay at the front desk. She say no you have to pay here and one of your friendly chef over heard we we talking so came and tell the waitress that she cannot charge us because we are the hotel guests and have to pay at the front desk. Then she call the front desk and check, the front desk ask her to write over any we pay at the front desk. What the hell is happening to this hotel?? Later i ask her can we pay now at the cafe so we can go straight to our room, she said OK can. Then we settle the bill. But in the evening when we check out and return the keys another receptionist with black jacket says we still have not pay for our breakfast!!!I told We did pay this morning already, she not even check and say no you still haven't pay and there is no record for we had paid!!! üò° üò° üò° After an argument with her I told her that maybe you can check with the chef there because he saw us paying. What i like is the hotel let me check in earlier by many hours without charging for it. I have checked in around 10am having our breakfast and check out on the same night around 8pm. Stayed in August 2020"
878,Hotel Boss,8.0,‚Äú Great if your needs are basic and simple ‚Äù,"People placed their rubbish outside the room, on the floor. Nobody clear them. Worry it will attract roaches in the Long run.
Stayed for 2 nights. No one came into the room for cleaning. 
Shower room is tiny. Be cramp for people on the extra-large side.
Half of the window facing public housing flat, so I‚Äôm conscious of people looking in.
Tv reception is real bad, fuzzy , let alone internet. High floor. Beautiful scene. Loved gazing out of the window and see part of the city view.
Sufficient for one person. I mean, the size of the room.
Quiet, at least during the day if one needs rest or to do work. 
Very basic facilities. Sufficient for simple stay.
Though the shower room is tiny, the toilet is clean and nice. More spacious. Stayed in July 2020"

920,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,9.2,Awesome,Nothing Great location and good facilities Stayed in December 2019
921,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,4.0,‚Äú Perhaps I expected too much ! ‚Äù,"Cleanliness. So dusty everywhere in the bedroom, bathroom is full of black mold!! And at the main entrance, glass roof top and windows are lack of cleaning and so dirty that sunlight cannot  pass through fully.  Yellow stained glassdoor at the entrance makes the lobby so dark .. no one cares about all the little details in small things what a 5 star hotel, they claimed to be, should be .. only 3 stars or less delivery in my opinion .. on the first night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep because my room is full of black mold which it was hidden by wallpaper which is badly done. And a light without a switch was brightly shined on my face. I didn‚Äôt take a shower despite a long journey,  because the bathroom was so dirty !!! Black mold between tiles, glass panel silicone sealing, the glass door hinches and along the wall skirting .. it is a room full of health hazzrads ! Even on the air con vent ! I had a room changed the next day, the room was better than the first one but it was still so poorly maintained .. this upset me so much!  Then the wedding banquet room.. it was so dirty on the floor, and so messy .. I am so sorry for what the wedding couples have  to pay .. understood that  casual labours are hard to find, but they all should be better trained in banquet serving, becauee its someone‚Äôs wedding !! Its big deal !! Perhaps should remove that stand at your front desk, the award for 5 stars hotel !! Or, May be I was in bad luck!! Doorman and Susan from front office are the two best faces at the front of the hotel.  Susan has demonstrated a professionalism what a 5 stars hotel guest deserved!  She is sympathetic, efficient and very profesional.  She is good to all her guests ! She did beyond what an FO has to do .. I hope the hotel will cherish this invaluable emplyee and further her career  to the next higher level .. The city view is great from the high floor. The buffet looked good. The area outside the hotel is very nice for walking around.  Pizzas at the italian restaurant, Grassini, was very good and tasty, thin and crispy base. But pasta was a bit disappointed, room guests get 30% off which is great for value. Stayed in October 2019"

967,Hotel Boss,7.9,Good,"The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about the property were the rooms sizes. Felt like the photos are deceiving. Had to upgrade my room upon going to my room and realizing it was a matchbox. Even with the upgrade it was still small for two adults and a toddler in my opinion. Luggage had to go on the balcony and we seen many others that did the same. I went ahead and paid for the breakfast everyday but asked for a refund which I received after a few questioning. I was told it would be continental. I asked for elaboration and was told American Style , I.e pancakes , waffles , bacon , eggs ... it wasn‚Äôt. Nonetheless, that‚Äôs all I would have to say disappointment me. Location was perfect. Walking distance from tons of restaurants, shops, & malls. Easily accessible for public transportation. Bus stop is literally out front. Was able to save on taxi cost by utilizing public transportation. Which was also easy to use. The bus drivers were friendly as we asked for assistance. The hotel Staff was nice and helpful as well explaining the public transportation system to us as well. Good english which was a plus. Loved that there was a few bars and restaurants directly under the hotel as well as a convenient mart. Stayed in January 2020"
968,Hotel Boss,6.0,‚Äú The overall tour was nice except the rent they had taken its too much. Average tour. P & F mismatch. ‚Äù,Rooms are so small or I should say tiny room. Its little bit expensive if I consider the facilities. I like the location & the lobby only. Stayed in January 2020

I asked the shelf above the hanging clothes rack to be cleaned as there was a thick layer of dust, this was not done. We then moved and found the same problem in that room. It looks like the cleaner forgets to clean this area of the room. And I guess this is for all rooms. Also the family rooms were to small with no storage for clothes, just one small rack, we had to keep most things in the suitcases.

Next time i prefer a cheaper accomodation. This hotel is a friendly and clean accomodation, built in modern style. Easy to find (next to Lavender MRS). More attractions below 1 km by walk. If you prefer only sleep it's enough. Every day you got 1 or 2 bottle of 0.5l water, and filled with coffe/tea bags. If your room is near in the highest floor, you get a lovely view to the city.

1158,Hotel Boss,3.0,‚Äú Dorminatry and nothing else!! ‚Äù,"i didn't like almost everything about this place.
absolutely shockingly Small in almost every aspect. it is very fancy outside with no substance inside.
the concierge did not even tried to great us or help with luggage. There were so many people in reception that you felt as another small fish in the tank. We were greeted by reception staff that just followed ""the book"" and protocol to check us in and move to the next guest
Rooms are shockingly small and all photography has been done with wide lenses and marking purposes.
when you are in the room and the bag is on the floor to take things out (note- there is no other place for it at all anyway) you need to jump over the bag to get to your bed.
It's a shocker for the amount of money they charge.
as i wrote a review on a trip advisor, i missed a few key signs in the first place:
why would a good hotel put a photo of laundry in the featured photos??!!
I have been asked to pay in full for the whole stay at check in!! what it means to us is that it's a point of no return - you can't check out after the first ruined night and move to another place.
the third one - watch for the hangers in the room above the TV !! the rooms are so ""practical"" that there is no space for a wardrobe!
before checking I sent some messages - there was no reply either.
The bathroom is so small that there is no space to put a toilet paper roll, and there is NO Toilet paper at all. There are  paper tissues somewhere above your head.
Also, you can forget about sitting on the toilet normally!! - there is no space to put your leg normally - the show glass is next to the seat.!
if you get an internal corner room, you will face another window 2 meters away from another hotel room, and if you're not feeling yourself already in the prison and want to look outside, you will see reflection of yourself which is not limited to your own but also reflections or views of all your neighbours across multiple floors .. Tell you honestly there was nothing to like about it except location .,.. sorry. Stayed in September 2022"
1159,Hotel Boss,3.0,‚Äú Will not be considering this hotel unless a much better room set up is offered ‚Äù,The whole bathroom layout and set up is completely wrong toilet paper holder in the wrong spot the shower handles not working appropriately water not heating up or cooling down when adjusted air conditioning unit in my room was continuously running when it was turned off Beds were too hard pillow was not appropriate AC in the room noisy even though I turned off the air conditioning it was still running for the two days which was very very noisy bathroom was not clean shower handle was broken popped off a few times I had to screwed back on and most importantly toilet paper is behind your head really that so stupid Stayed in October 2022
1160,Hotel Boss,5.0,Fair,"The room was very very small, not soundproof, and cleaning services were not provided every day. The location is very close to restaurants and within walking distance of shopping malls. Stayed in October 2022"
1161,Hotel Boss,3.0,Poor,"1) Rooms were dusty. Bathroom walls and ceiling had fungus. 
2)When our rooms weren't done/cleaned on day 2, we called reception to ask for emptying our overflowing garbage bins and changing the dirty towels atleast. The response from staff was rude when we requested for the same (one person said I have other jobs and walked away with me holding the garbage bin). The manager / staff at the reception was also super rude and said they don't clean rooms everyday!! 
Even the days when housekeeping did the rooms, it was half done. 
3) Breakfast buffet was extremely boring and tasteless except for the fruits.
4) We took a triple room which was supposed to accommodate 2 adults + 2kids. It just about fit us in with no room for free movement
5) It was an extremely busy hotel with what I'm assuming is near-full occupancy. So, they didn't seem to care about the quality or guests at all. Stayed in October 2022"

Due to tapping our card to check the options (which were nonexistent), they proceeded to argue about charging us 40 dollars, despite stating our argument multiple times. Pathetic service.... Pathetic food... Very small rooms... Absolute waste. Rooms did not get cleaned daily and even it was cleaned done poorly. No change of linen..... very bad hotel experience for a 4Star hotel.

1310,Hotel Boss,5.0,Fair,"Firstly the whole ad on booking.com was very unclear. I selected this hotel as i was travelling with my family and the ad  stated breakfast included. But unfortunately in my booking the breakfast wasn't included and there was no option in the booking so i presumed this was included in the cost until i arrived and went for breakfast the next day. Totally disappointed as had to pay a big amount for breakfast for x 4 during my stay
The breakfast was not worth the amount I paid for as could have few more choices included
Secondly The rooms were not sound proof as I  could hear the next door neighbour shouting and celebrating late night or early morning until 0400  specially after me having tiring days
Lastly the air con and TV in the room was useless. Had to report few times until the TV got sorted and air con never  
Overall an okay stay as was out most of the days 
For family of 4 the room size and storage facilities for suitcases was not great The hotel was near the city centre good access to little India and to the other side to city
The lobby area was good and staff at reception was helpful Stayed in August 2022"

Furthermore, i heard the water running non-stop, which is really annoying. The cleanness is poor. The policy didn't provide enough support to be able to clean the room everyday. it's not a good sign during the continued rising of COVID cases in Singapore.

1366,Hotel Boss,4.0,‚Äú NO to Hotel Boss ‚Äù,"1. Limited space in the room.
2. TV channels are only local!
3. The absence of hand towel or face towel
4. No sheer curtain. Lack of privacy. .For 2 nights at SGD416.00 NO Breakfast, it's expensive. We didn't have any good experience in the hotel.
1. The aircon was noisy that we had problems to sleep.
2. The room is so compact. There is hardly room for moving about in the room. Opening up of the luggage is difficult due to the small space in the room. 
3. Luggage stand is unsturdy.

1371,Hotel Boss,2.0,‚Äú Really depressing place ‚Äù,"I felt like staying in prison when staying in this hotel, the window was facing a dark inner yard and I could not see the sky, and there was some continuous noise coming from the building itself making me feel really anxious.

Had to pay extra to upgrade from a triple room to a family room just so we could use the extra balcony space to dump our pram and suitcases.Hotel being used as Covid isolation residence so that was a bit unnerving.Housekeeping is once every 2 days because they are ""going green"", but when we asked them to come every day (kids make a mess!) they refused and just dumped a cardboard box of towels and water bottles in our room.

1396,Hotel Boss,2.0,‚Äú Honest Review - Unfriendly rude staff ‚Äù,"We found the staff so unfriendly and rude! Especially at breakfast, I am not sure if it was the Hotel Breakfast Manager but he was extremely rude and grumpy. The Reception staff was also rude as well and such an unfriendly face. The rooms are very small and tight! Rooms only get cleaned every other day. Laundry was over crowded and not sufficient Iron for so many people. You will have to wait hours to be able to iron your clothes and don‚Äôt get me started with the washing. If you do want to go ahead, make sure you are prepared to have wrinkled clothes, or bring an iron. Be prepared for a grumpy and moody breakfast staff. If you are a family, make sure you stay out till late and just arrive at the hotel to sleep in and not chill as no space in room. Great location Stayed in July 2022"

1403,Hotel Boss,1.0,‚Äú Over priced experience ‚Äù,"Hotel Boss was a complete and utter disappointment, for the price that you pay, you expect atleast clean linen, good service, and in general a decent room.
The room was dirty, including the linen,and windows, our AC didnt work so we called for assistance and nobody arrived. Over-all a terrible experience and over priced. The only good this was the initial reception serice from Alex, who thorougly showed us where to go on a map for certain things. Stayed in July 2022"
1404,Hotel Boss,1.0,‚Äú Select an alternative to this hotel or else U WILL REGRET!!! ‚Äù,"The baggage staff is the worst I have ever seen in my travelling history. During check-in I requested to send my baggage to room and they refused instantly and asked me to carry all 4 of them on my own unlike many hotels which always provides these services. Later when I was checking out, I asked for 4 baggage cards for my bags and their behaviour was awful. They started shouting and even the manager is such a shameless that he did not even care about my complain and asked the staff to snatch my baggage cards (screaming). Dreadful experience, felt like I was not even served like a customer! The swimming pool is dirty and polluted. The rooms are very small and room service is provided every 2 days which is unacceptable from such a hotel. Location Stayed in July 2022"
1405,Hotel Boss,4.0,Disappointing,"1st room given was not clean; pillow cases had stains & bed sheets had strands of hair. The shower was like pinprick of needles. When asked housekeeping to change the sheets they asked me to go to front desk to change room. I had to move everything myself to the new room. Next morning complained to the duty manager on the new room cleanliness & left for work. When I returned, the room was swept but mop or broom strands were on the floor & furniture was not moved to sweep the dust. Table tops were not wiped. Was OK for the next 2 nights as I was told housekeeping comes in every 2 days. But on Sunday morning, the only day I slept in, the housekeeping rings the doorbell at 9am to wake me up! Lost wifi for most of Friday evening & Saturday whole day. Service resumes on Monday only. Front desk staff are polite & try to help, but the housekeeping staff are below expectations. This is a hotel with 100 rooms per floor & there are at least 15 floors in that hotel; the rooms are well photographed to look spacious but in fact are quite small. The layout in the rooms are not as smart to similar sized rooms like G Hotel. Sadly disappointing experience.... Location is great. Stayed in July 2022"

1630,Hotel Boss,3.3,Poor,"The rooms are smaller ( just like a study room) and when we walked in on day 1 rooms were  stinking too. I had to keep it open so that some fresh air can come in. In case you are carrying a big suitcase, then you won't find proper space to open it up.  Day 2 post room clean up,  ants were found on the bed and bathroom. Seems like they didn't even change the bed linens. When I reported to the cleaning boy, he was cool about it. Don't expect any in house restaurants. Getting a glass of milk for the baby was also a big task. Totally disappointed with the stay. Stayed in October 2019"
