2,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,“ 2D1N for a family staycation ”,"I booked 2rooms , one of the room 1333 bathroom door was not secured on the bottom track. Was afraid that it will fall when we slide the door .  The chair beside the bed can see dust on it. Love the location . It near to everywhere u want to go. I booked deluxe king but was upgrade to premier king as i needed 2 rooms to be close to each other. Stayed in October 2022"
3,Royal Plaza on Scotts,9.0,"“ excellent location, comfortable stay ”","slow room service. They don’t take calls after 8 pm easily if you call on landline. Best location, very clean, good veg food options in buffet. extremely comfortable stay. highly recommended and also for Indian vegetarian families Stayed in October 2022"
4,Royal Plaza on Scotts,9.0,“ not much of a variety for breakfast ”,nothing near shopping areas Stayed in September 2022
5,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,“ Was not as we remembered it in September 2017 when we last stayed there. ”,That there was no Executive Lounge anymore!  We booked on the basis that this still existed with afternoon tea and evening cocktails and were not told in advance that it had been discontinued. Location and housekeeping. Our room was always made up to a high standard each day. Stayed in October 2022
6,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,“ just nice ”,nothing strategic location for shopping Stayed in September 2022
7,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,Very Good,"Near to Orchard Road - for shopping, food and MRT access. Easy connection to shops underground - good for rainy days - we did not get wet! Stayed in September 2022"
8,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,“ satisfied and happy ”,"maybe the rooms need a little make over, they haven’t changed a lot since my last stay back in 2016 and I wouldn’t say that it is 5 star hotel maybe a really really good 4 star hotel. the staff was really friendly and helpful, messages were answered very quick and also my request for early check in and connected rooms were considered. I was so happy about it! the rooms were really clean and the location was perfect to explore Singapore! the mrt station was just a 5 min walk away and there were a lot (!!!) shopping malls and food places around the hotel. I would come back again :) Stayed in September 2022"
9,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,"“ Very well located hotel in a very clean environment, which made us feel comfortable ”",Coffee machines at breakfast did not suit my taste Very clean rooms. Efficient lift service. The 11th floor looked better than the 10th floor where we stayed the previous week Stayed in September 2022
10,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,“ We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and overall great value for money! ”,The warm breakfast choices could have been better. Staff do not upsell Singapore to tourists for some reason. They don't make recommendations for tourist attractions etc. neither do they give any local travel advice. Would suggest little more friendlier approach to customers as well. This does not only apply to the hotel but also to the taxi drivers. In most countries the taxi drivers love meeting tourists and conversing but in Singapore they just ask you for destination and at the end they give you the amount owing. Thats it! The room was clean and well serviced. The aircon was also very effective. Stayed in September 2022
11,Royal Plaza on Scotts,9.0,“ Good choice. ”,"a bit noisy but it's at day time so it's ok, The hotel should manage check in and check out line because some people do not on the line when other waited to check. Location , comfy bed, service Stayed in September 2022"

22,Royal Plaza on Scotts,8.0,“ Comfortable stay at good location! ”,"The breakfast closes at 10 am. We as family with young kids, would have preferred if the breakfast timing was until 11am or at least until 10.30. The spread was fine but needs more vegetarian options. Room service as well should have good vegetarian options or snacks or at least could be more accommodating with such requests. We had booked super twin room for our family of 4 (2 adults + 2 kids) but it seemed bit small for us so requested them to check if any better options available. They suggested the junior suite at additional cost which we checked and took up. The check-in and check-out process was very smooth. The suite was very comfortable. The staff was excellent- very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was fine. Stayed in August 2022"
23,Royal Plaza on Scotts,7.0,“ Value for money in terms of room and location but lacking in service. ”,"There was no readily available concierge or bell service to help guests bring their luggage up to the room. Also, we noticed that the rooms were not cleaned daily. This is something expected when we book a hotel. Stayed in August 2022"

We checked in at 3am next day and expected already the room was set but the extra bed request was not ready. The breakfast was okay and we had to wait for omelette so long. There was a broken soup spoon that I told the staff to clean up but it wasn't done until we finished breakfast. Tea was already premade and bad. Good location and nice river view.

35,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,“ Will repeat if next time in Singapore ”,Early check in / small waiting area. Had booked 2 rooms and travelled for almost 24 hours and needed to crash in at least one of them approx 11-11.30 am. Would have been ok with even one of the 2. offered to pay extra.They did point us to the waiting area but that had only 4-5 chairs.

37,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,"“ Great location, great breakfast, great comfort! ”","Some surfaces in the bathroom looked to be in need of repair.  Moreover, the WiFi login page would not work for me.  Granted, I am on a Linux Operating System and no doubt that is the reason.  However, I'm sure the hotel pays a company or service to set up and maintain the WiFi.  There's no good reason why that company can't ensure access even to Linux, and the hotel should demand it. I liked the room interior, the rooftop pool, and the breakfast.  Also, the location is excellent. Stayed in October 2022"

Nothing to complain about. Stayed in September 2022"
73,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,6.0,“ A fair facility for the price as the other hotels in Singapore seems to cost much more. ”,"There was no hair conditioner provided beside the shower gel and shampoo.  There was also no razor provided as well. These items are inexpensive and that could make things so much easier for the hotel guests. This might be an oversight or an effort trying to save a few pennies.The security safety deposit box in the room is relatively small. My 15-inch computer could not fit in the safe. The hot water in the washing basin took a long while to get hot. The hot water in the shower was hard to control, it was either too hot or not warm enough. The first night I found the safety deposit box did not work, I asked for it to be fixed on the next day when I was out working. However, this did not happen as promised. I have to called again on the third day. It did get fixed fairly quickly. The breakfast was fair and reasonable. The food selection was acceptable but standard. Several staff have excellent attitude and very helpful that exceeded my expectations, such as Peter the front office manager, who kindly extended my checkout time by a couple of hours, the young man who booked the taxi for me and a lady at the breakfast bar who made a hot chocolate for me and brought it to my table personally. The room is fairly clean, no complaints here, except it feels quite small, feels a bit close in. The air conditioner was good. the bed was nice comfy and not too hard and not too soft for me.  It was just right.The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to orchard road, which is the CBD of Singapore. A classy shopping street that you could find most of famous and expensive brands there. Stayed in October 2022"

75,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,6.0,"“ Good Location, Friendly Staff ”","The cost of the breakfast is crazy expensive and not worth it when you can walk into Orchard and eat for a fraction of the price and better food.We had some checkin issues that took a long time to fix and we were checked out after our first night and then needed to check back in which was annoying. This was bcoz we used booking.com to extend our stay and come one night earlier (pre done) but on their system it showed as two seperate bookings. The hotel gym is really good.The staff are pleasant.It is close to MRT and an easy walk into Orchard. Stayed in October 2022"

83,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,7.0,"“ Good for a stop over, nothing flash, clean and tidy, good location ”","Coffee tea etc in rooms didn't refill and not enough thereof at any point. This was despite being requested twice, not a big issue but annoying.
Couldn't buy a coffee anywhere there, no team on.
Rooms are probably more ibis size than mercure so small in other words. 
Not all the facilities are back up to pre covid action so some of the attached restaurants etc not always open.
There is a 7-11 there that is constantly got a ""back in 30 minutes"" sign up which is bloody annoying but not the fault of mercure obviously.
Had to specifically request housekeeping towels etc to be changed for immuno comprised, and had to remind which is not good.
House keeping repeatedly turned off air con when we left it on purpose. (Also part of the immuno comprised thing) Then on last day removed the card altogether so couldn't turn it on and leave it on, this is very annoying.
The fridge in the room did not cool anything down at all and requests to have it fixed were ignored. Good location, friendly team, secure, easy to get to and from around the city. (use Grab app is my advice)
Pool and everything is as shown in photos etc.
Very good.

The service was very warm welcoming and pleasant. But the service is only at reception and premier lounge. However, the premier lounge was a great place to have the meals with the splendid view.

We had to HUNT the staff down to get any information. In the end we have to pin down staff by not allowing them to close the door that leads to the office behind reception and make sure that they could still see us waiting for them to come up with a solution and get them to take responsibility for THEIR problem and find us other suitable accommodation at no extra cost to us, which they did in the end, after around 4 hours of waiting.Still no apology or compensation for the wait and disruption after getting off a 14 hour flight from the UK and walking in to their shambles.We thought they would at least not expect us to pay for all of the stay due to the disruption - but no - they took their full money almost a week late. Possibly to help cover the cost of the failure in their system.Management need to go on some course to better themselves in how to look after their customers instead of hiding in the back room hoping it will go away - Communicate with those affected and they will be appreciated.

I like that they have a free pocket wifi. Smooth checkin and checkout, didn’t took long. Staff are friendly. Hotel decor, furnishings are nice, bright and modern.

Good on site facilities including gym and spa. Bar is a good set up. Stayed in April 2022"
259,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,Very Good,Some of the furniture was a little old and did not function very well such as the lamps. The TV was also outdated and did not have modern features like the other hotels such as screen casting option. The view from my room was amazing and the staff were friendly. The check in and check out process was very smooth. Stayed in April 2022
260,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,“ A wonderful and relaxing stay. ”,"The room could use brighter lightings.  It's rather dim.  There's also not enough electrical outlet.  Would be nice if there's some beside the bed so that I can charge my phone while I am using it.   I also wish the cups in the room are much bigger too as I finished my coffee in a few sips and have to make again and again. Love the free upgrade by booking.com.   The room upgrade was a sightly bigger so all thumbs up.   The bathroom was big and the bathtub was good size, especially for a tall person.  I enjoyed soaking at the bathtub after a long day at work.  The room was quiet and sound proof.  I enjoyed relaxing on the bed watching tv and that's something you cannot take for granted as I will never get to relax myself if I am at home. Stayed in April 2022"
261,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.0,“ Great location but hotel offerings were poor. ”,The room was drab and dull although i booked one of the more premium rooms. There was very inadequate lighting. Last time I stayed in the standard double and that felt much better in terms of quality and feel. Receptionist was rude and didnt give us a late check out even though there was availability. He said id have to pay and it wont be complimentary. I had the option of late checkout included in my room package. Breakfast options were very very limited. Location was good.

263,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.0,“ It's the wrong place and wrong time ”,"Hotel facilities were NOT for 5 stars. Atleast 3 stars. We kept receiving emails to check in online with payment confirmation although stated to pay on arrival. Our credit card was charged 2x small amounts and was promised to be refunded but no follow-up!! Checked in also took so long, the 1st customer service had no idea what to do until the 2nd person helped him. Room are big and outdated, tv has no movies channel, only news about Russia n war or plenty local channel either in Chinese or indian languages which we don't understand. Breakfast food so standard no fresh food or fresh bread or croissants, stuff barely understood English there. We checked out a day early for emergency flight back to Perth as our pet sick then died not long after. We asked for refund for our last day stay which was promised to follow up with the manager but nothing happened instead still getting email and messages to advise the hotel our checked out time a day after we left to Perth. Don't think they're up to date with technology or guests details and information online. Not much to like as its far by foot or transport from the locals attractions, restaurants. Nearby restaurants were pricey for average indian small portions food. Stayed in April 2022"
264,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.0,“ Fun staycation. Value for money. Would recommend. ”,"The check-in process could have been faster. Perhaps one more staff to oversee the process.

280,Mercure Singapore On Stevens,9.0,"“ Good sized, comfortable room. A bit off from the major attractions. ”","First of all the location might be an issue if you need to be close to the major attractions. For me it was not a bid deal since I like walking. In one sense, its distance to the major attractions was a plus in my case. What I didn't like was the separation of the breakfasts. There was a restaurant next to the infinity pool and also another one near the entrance. Even though they seemed to be serving the same buffet for some reason some guests were using the one close to the entrance and the others were allowed to the one next to the pool. I didn't like the idea to be turned from the door when I tried to enter the one next to the pool. We had our breakfast downstairs which was kind of more crowded... Singapore is not a very good destination when it comes to the accommodation. First of all it is very expensive if you look for a large room. Even decent sized rooms are very expensive. On the other hand Mercure Orchard offers a nice room with acceptable price. The tradeoff is the location. It is a bit off the major attractions. Even though the name is Orchard walking to Orchard street would take at least 15-20 minutes if you are fast! But the hotel is nice. I would stay there next time as well. The breakfast was good, the infinity pool was very relaxing after a long walking day. Stayed in December 2019"

394,Hotel Boss,6.0,"“ Tiny cramped room, good location and amenities ”","Room was extremely tiny and cramped for space. Hard to walk around the bed without bumping into the walls  Room wasn't cleaned daily. I had to request the room to be cleaned on day 3 of my 4 day stay. This also meant that the tea, coffee and water was not restocked daily and I had to call reception each night to provide these. To the staff's credit though, these arrived promptly. No proper/working exhaust/dehumidifier in the bathroom/shower meant the shower remained wet and the bathroom humid throughout the stay. Its a big hotel so needs to be managed better. Good location near downtown Singapore with Lavender MRT and Bugis MRT at walking distance. Excellent breakfast with good variety of items. On-site laundry facility.

have to go down to reception multiple times to activate or reactivate the cards. 
even reception had to come to the door few times. 
don’t like the window view, horribly facing an apartment kitchen altho in the middle of a shopping belt; Orchard Road! 
breakfast wasn’t interesting & repetitive. 
toilet vanity glass shelf was not clean with specs of dirt. 
steam iron emits rusty residues have to be careful to control temperatures.

Situated on the river a short walk from various quayside restaurants etc it was a good location and for our stay was reasonably priced. Stayed in November 2019"

452,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,8.3,,This review is hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
453,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.0,“ It was a pleasant stay overall. ”,"The breakfast spread was a little disappointing as I would have expected more choices. The Check In was slow. We had the deluxe room. There was a little smell and the room can do with some upgrading. The prompt response of the property and it's location. Near to town city and the accessibility from Robertson Quay to Boat Quay. Stayed in October 2019"
454,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,6.3,“ 2 days Singapore ”,"This is definitely NOT a 5 star Hotel, We had for 2 nights 3 rooms, 
1st Room smelling like a smokers room,
2nd room, although it supposed to be a 2person room, only 1 bed side table, light-switches on 1 side only, bed unstable, if you move your partner will wake up due to the “swinging”
3rd room, noisy as it was behind the elevators. 
All rooms the carpet was not really good cleaned. 
 
Bathroom nice, but.... neither in the bathtub nor shower a separate shower, so only from above or fill the tub. 
As said, for 3 or maybe 4 star a very good hotel, but definitely NOT a 5 star. 
We regret we booked it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Stayed in October 2019"

457,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.9,“ Could be better ”,"The service. A few examples, they got my name wrong at check in, we waited almost 2 hours for a Greek salad from room dine in service, took them a long time to send some bottled drinking water, just name a few. Also, no idea why but the room kept feeling quite warm even after adjusting the temperature to the lowest at 20 deg Celsius. The location is nice with a lot of nice bars and restaurants around it, very near to city centre as well. The room is quite sizable for Singapore and its clean. Stayed in October 2019"
458,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.5,“ Reasonable good ”,Should give me upgrade bigger room with table so that I can do my work. May be future give me above 21st storey instead of 17 storey. Breakfast is good but only Siew mai was serve on 28 Oct 2019. Stayed in October 2019

462,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,7.0,“ Comfortable stay ”,"The staff worked incredibly hard at breakfast, but seemed very understaffed. This meant it was not really five star service. Tables were not laid and mugs ran out, for coffee, so disposable cups were used and plastic spoons for yoghurt. In a three star hotel in Bali, there were 4 times the staff for the same size area.

If visiting the breakfast area after around 0900 it is very very chatoic. Simply my thoughts. We also booked two club rooms for the family, I am very sure that whilst our daughters did not make an issue of it I have no doubt when I first walked in to ensure all was in order, that this room had been a smoking room or used by smokers even though I believe we were offered non smoking rooms.

Despite filling in loads of pre arrival information including credit card info - they insist on doing it all again at check in, it took over 20 minutes to get my key. maintenance staff decided to work around the pool during may one visit, to erect new parasols, they were so load I left; I feel sure a real 5 star hotel would do this when there were no customers around!

Sometimes only one towel was left. The hotel is old and in desperate need of upkeep. The carpets are stained and does not deserve the money being asked for it. The breakfast lacked choice and it was boring. The reception was beleaguered and so busy. It took about 30 minute to check us in. Liked how quickly our room was cleaned and how quickly the staff responded to requests. The bed linen was comfortable and the abundance of bottled water helped. The bartender is very lovely and helped when my husband knocked over a cocktail. Stayed in June 2022"

- Overpriced given the quality of the facility
- horrible room cleaniness, dust on bed, bedside lamps, table, TV, hair on the bed, lobby carpet is dusty with dirt clogged into the carpet
Seems the hotel management only focused in extracting money rather than fixing the hotel. Yet hotel claims they need 4 hours to clean the room. Given the quality of the hotel cleaniness, it shows that the cleaner only spent 5 minute per room to clean
- Air-conditioning and electrical switches hanging
- hotel eating away 2 hours of time from standard check in and checkout timing. Now the timing are 3 pm checkin and 11 am checkout. 
Unfortunately I cannot attach all the pics and videos taken to this survey but given the unreasonable amount charged by the hotel, they do not deserve even 1 star. Pathetic and horrible experience Only location and free car park Stayed in June 2022"

640,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,“ Not what you expect from a 5star hotel ”,"This is far from a 5star hotel. At most, the hotel will qualify as a 3star hotel. The front lobby appears very nice and modern as you would expect from a 5star hotel however we were very disappointed with the standard of our room. The room was unkept, dusty, very dated and had mould on the shower and shower curtains.

706,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,“ Disappointing. ”,"Arrived early at the hotel and requested an early checkin and was informed a charge of 80S$. I refused to pay this and requested if we could leave our baggage with them whilst we can stroll around the hotel.  We were informed it was not possible until we had our flaw test results. We stayed in room 1610.  Carpets in the room looked outdated and dirty. Bathroom floor and wardrobe shelfs were dusty.Disappointing to learn a five star hotel had not managed to keep up with the 5 star rating. Mini bar  and condiments were empty. Mini fridge was empty  and was told it was due to pandemic Next day at breakfast, I asked for a banana and was told they had run out.No alternatives was offered. Poor service. Went to reception for help to book tickets for the flower and cloud dome attraction. Paul very Kindly arranged this request and I made a payment with my Amex card. Cost was S 120.00 $. went on google to learn the combined  tickets was 80.00S$. once again I was extremely disappointed to learn that Paul did not advice me of this and booked two separate events costing me additional 40.00 S$. I requested Paul to cancel my tickets and rebook them at a cheaper  rate. I was informed by him that a refund can only be given at the venue. When we got to the venue I was informed that it will take 21 days to get my refund and I will receive a email accordingly. I was asked to pay again for the tickets which was 56.00 S$. All this was added uninvited hassle. On the 8th evening returning to our hotel room, we found unwashed coffee cups  and no replenish of water, tea or coffee.Dirty cloth along with dirty coffee cups were left in the bathroom sink. I called up the reception who agreed to replenish water bottles and some coffee. I was also informed  a day time duty manager will call me in the morning to take up with my complaint. This never happened. Overall it was a disappointing experience which was not expected on our  special 40th wedding annivesary. First impression of hotel was excellent. Check-in was smooth and was very quick.Kindly given an an early check in which we were very grateful .Lobby was clean and inviting. We stayed in room 1610. Views from the room was great.

For the price we got, the family room was kinda small compared to other similar rated hotels we stayed in.
Even though the room has a balcony.. But there's totally no view as the balcony was facing other rooms balconies..
We had to wait for more than 30 mins to just go to the swimming pool. Overall, it wasn't a memorable stay. Despite the setbacks of the stay, I do like the breakfast served and the restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.

I was assured there would be a room the next day. I was shocked to find out that there isnt a room and the staff simply didnt want to listen to my explanation. The duty manager in charge wasnt empathetic at all. He was more concerned of defending himseld instead of listening to me. Whats a duty manager for then?

Indicated in message on booking.com as well as the front desk upon check-in that it was my wife’s birthday but nothing was done to make our stay memorable. Highlighted another time to lounge manager and was advised to get a cake myself from the deli downstairs because the hotel
did not have a record of my request. No remediation was also offered to make up for our noisy room/disturbed sleep. Previous day’s staff seemed more helpful/amenable. Brilliant view of Singapore River/ skyline. (river view)

780,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,1.0,“ Flee far from this place ”,"We had an early check in on 15 Dec, left our luggages in the room and went out the entire day. When we returned to the room, the television was turned on and one of the luggages seemed to be have been moved. Feeling uncomfortable we went down to the front desk asking for a room change. The staff who attended to us flatly rejected our request for reasons being that 1) he had guaranteed that no one had entered the room and 2) he cited that there was no available room with a queen bed of the equivalent room rate that we had paid. Instead he offered twin beds for the night or queen beds only from the next day. As we were on a couple staycation, sleeping separately on twin beds wasn't what we wanted and so we were seemingly left with no choice but to sleep in discomfort for the night and to accept the room change from the next day. The thing was we checked online and found that there were rooms available with queen beds but of higher room rate (thought for a five star hotel ensuring the comfort/ safety of guest should have been of priority but seemingly does not appear so for Copthorne).
Claudia attended to us the next day and granted us a room change of the higher room rate as we narrated the episode that happened the previous night and informed of the faulty air condition in the room where the temperature was perpetually at 15°C. Claudia had arranged for the bellman to shift our luggages to the new room and we went out the entire day. When we returned to our new room in the night, our luggages were nowhere to be found. We called the front desk inquiring on the whereabouts of our luggages and the staff explained that we would receive it in 30 min. Feeling tired after an entire day out and just wanting to wash up, we told the staff we would just pick up the luggages ourselves if it was going to take that long however the staff was unable to locate the luggages. After demanding that we receive our luggages ASAP, they found it and gave it to us in less than 10... Couldn't say I liked anything about our stay with Copthorne but I'd give credit to one staff (Claudia) the only person who did the right thing. Stayed in December 2021"

782,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,3.0,"“ Take it from me - coming from a 5 star hotel, this hotel is obviously not a 5 star. ”","So many things I am listing here.1) Waited 2 hours to check in despite being told I can check in at 2pm. In the end I checked in just after 4pm. I had to postpone my surprise for my husband because of the long wait. What bothers me is how long check in takes, and I am not sure if they are delaying it due to overbooking. Regardless, waiting numbers should have just been issued to guests while they sit and wait instead of making us stand for over 2 hours (I know people who waited more only to be told there were no more rooms).2) Our room was not made at all. No surprises for the poor service. 3) Our room was beside the lift and it was very noisy. I called to request for ear plugs and was told that she would call back when she got it. I called back and she told me to hold on. All the way till we slept, I never had that call back. Poor service.4) Pool was small, but it is what it is. 5) Breakfast was average. If you just want to fill your stomach, it would do. My scrambled eggs were dripping in liquid. 1) To be fair, Javin from Front Office upgraded a room for us which was big and comfortable. The view was overlooking the road, but getting a room was the most important. 2) Hotel gave complimentary cake because of our anniversary. 3) Hotel was flexible letting us in the pool if there were no shows. 4) Location was good too.

Check in took 93 minutes. The restaurant refused us entry despite arriving 20 minutes prior to published closing time. We were told that in-room dining was unavailable however after complaining to the duty manager it became miraculously available.  It took many calls to place an order for fish and chips – what arrived was reheated, dry and inedible. The next day despite several reminders the room was not cleaned, no fresh towels, toiletries or drinking water were provided.  We order in room dining early.   When nothing was delivered, we called again only to be told that the kitchen was not responding and that they will chase them.  They never called back. We called again we were told that the items we ordered (steak and a cake) despite being on the menu were not available and that absolutely no cake or steak of any kind was available and that very few items were available.  Starving we had to go out in the rain buy food. We asked to speak with the general manager we were told that he is not reachable.  We asked to speak to the duty manager we were told he was busy. After insisting that we speak with him we were told he will call back.  He never did after many chasers he finally returned our call.  After describing our experience, he told us that the hotel is extremely short of staff and unable to cope with demand, that they are hiring more staff and training them.   When asking what he intended to do about the dreadful nonexistent service he had no answer but said he would report the matter to the general manager.  When I asked if I could speak with the general manger, I was told he is unavailable .  I asked if an appointment could be made for the next day or the day after I was told that this cannot be guaranteed but that a note with my request would be left for him Needless to say he never contacted us.

Waited and waited again, went to the overcrowded lobby with long queues at 8pm where there wasnt any staff attending to the concierge. Fast forward, we only received the other 2 room keys at 8 plus pm…. From 3-8pm we were just waiting for nothing. Paid for nothing & the facilities were already fully booked. Paid so much just to sleep for a couple of hours. Nothing. Disappointing Stayed in December 2021"

We had to call and request for a late check out to compensate the time that was burnt which wasn’t even our fault and we only got 1 HOUR of late check out. We felt like we paid for 2days 2nights instead of 3 days two nights. The Hotel is nearby to almost any part of town from Marina Bay Sands to Orchad Road.

846,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,9.0,Awesome,"We reached the property at 10:30 am and were asked to pay 100$ plus taxes for an early check in . The conventional practice and courtesy in the hospitality industry is to let the guest check in if rooms are available .
Very cheap of them to fleece the guest in such a manner . I mean they can look at more ethical ways to generate revenue. Except for the way we were forced to pay for early check in the team delivered the goods. Stayed in December 2019"
847,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,10,“ Hotel was key in making our visit to Singapore great!!! ”,"Location was excellent as it was within walking distance of many attractions (Riverwalk, Marina, Chinatown...).  We booked the club room and the hotel staff that checked us in moved us to the 29th floor (same floor as lounge) on account that it was our 40th marriage anniversary.  Once we got into the room, we also found some goodies to help us celebrate... This level of consideration was totally unexpected and great.  The best part of our stay was the lounge staff (Steven, Ted, Ying Wei and Yani).  They couldn't do enough for us.  They were helpful in every way imaginable (serving breakfast/snacks and drinks, mapping out local places to eat and visit and making us feel at home in every way) ... they truly made this stay the most memorable (in a good way) of any hotel stay I can remember!  I would definitely stay at this hotel (with lounge access) again. Stayed in December 2019"

Can see many Malaysian staff staying there as may cannot go back to their country. Are we being treated like that. Your receptionist is that worse i see from so many hotels should have more training. We were asked whether we would like to have breakfast there if so we have to pay at the reception first, then I told her that I don't know what are we having how to pay first? She said maybe you like to go up and have a look then come back and pay. So we when up to the 4th floor cafe and when in, but no menu was shown! Just asked whether we could have western or local breakfast. Also not told what we will be serving!!! 😡 Then we were served our coffee and tea but it was not hot all just luke warm coffee and tea. After our breakfast then we thought we go to the reception and pay, your waitress chase after us and say we still have not pay for the breakfast then i told her the receptionist ask me to pay at the front desk. She say no you have to pay here and one of your friendly chef over heard we we talking so came and tell the waitress that she cannot charge us because we are the hotel guests and have to pay at the front desk. Then she call the front desk and check, the front desk ask her to write over any we pay at the front desk. What the hell is happening to this hotel?? Later i ask her can we pay now at the cafe so we can go straight to our room, she said OK can. Then we settle the bill. But in the evening when we check out and return the keys another receptionist with black jacket says we still have not pay for our breakfast!!!I told We did pay this morning already, she not even check and say no you still haven't pay and there is no record for we had paid!!! 😡 😡 😡 After an argument with her I told her that maybe you can check with the chef there because he saw us paying. What i like is the hotel let me check in earlier by many hours without charging for it. I have checked in around 10am having our breakfast and check out on the same night around 8pm.

883,Hotel Boss,8.0,“ Great if your needs are basic and simple ”,"People placed their rubbish outside the room, on the floor. Nobody clear them. Worry it will attract roaches in the Long run.
Stayed for 2 nights. No one came into the room for cleaning. 
Shower room is tiny. Be cramp for people on the extra-large side.
Half of the window facing public housing flat, so I’m conscious of people looking in.
Tv reception is real bad, fuzzy , let alone internet. High floor. Beautiful scene. Loved gazing out of the window and see part of the city view.
Sufficient for one person. I mean, the size of the room.
Quiet, at least during the day if one needs rest or to do work.

917,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,3.0,Poor,"The check-in is very slow, only one staff working at the reception. Only two other customers in front of me, then it almost take 10mins. 
The facility is quite old, the bathtub is not clean, of course not using it. The water is not hot enough for you to get a good shower, in fact it's cold. The air con didn't work properly, didn't get a good sleep because it's too hot. The phone in the room is not working, you have to use your own mobile phone find their number to call for service. 
Not all switches for the light is close to your bed, you have to get up to turn off the lights. 
Shower gel is too litttle. Checkout Stayed in March 2020"
918,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.4,“ Disappointed. Did not get what we paid for. ”,"Upon checking in we were advised by the Client Services Manager that they had decided to renovate the Club Lounge on the 29th floor for two of the nights we were booked in for and breakfast would be downstairs plus nightly drinks and canapés would be in the lobby bar. These renovations would have been planned prior and we were not advised of this until check in. There was only one barman in the bar looking after club guests and other guests. The food offered was well below the standard of other Club Lounges we have visited. We tried to contact the Client Services Manager to voice our dissatisfaction, however she did not bother to respond to us. The Club room we stayed in was tired and not to the normal standard of other hotels. Very disappointed. Location of property was good, easy walking distance to numerous restaurants along the river. Our first night we had the Club Lounge experience we paid for. Stayed in February 2020"

920,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,“ Disappointing ”,The room was quite dated. Smaller than expected. It didn't feel like a 5 star hotel on the floor where I stayed at all. The bed sheets had stains on them when we checked in. Overall this was a disappointing stay. The swimming pool. Stayed in January 2020
921,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,9.0,Awesome,Room 1106.  We could hear the elevator more than we would have liked but it didnt keep us awake.  There was a leak from the water faucet in the bathroom that slowly covered the counter. Bellman help with our luggage upon arrival and helping us find the room where we could book a last minute island tour.  He walked us all the way to the room rather than just providing directions.  Desk clerk was very helpful arranging to hold our luggage after we arrived at 0800 so we could go sightseeing.  The bellman that did deliver the luggage to our room was pleasant and professional. Stayed in January 2020
922,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,10,"“ Amazing, we would go again. ”","The location was perfect, it was central to most of the places we wanted to visit. The area was safe and allowed us to walk to most of our desired destinations, even late at night or the early hours of the morning. The staff were very friendly and always accommodating.

924,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,Fair,"There is no vibe in this hotel as it is now outdated and the reception is always loud as it is near the breakfast area, and at night it is even worse as people ate at a buffet.
Would expect more than a kettle and instant coffee tucked away in a cupboard in this type of hotel. Hard to believe its star rating. Stayed in January 2020"
925,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,5.0,Fair,"The card you had to use in the lifts to access different floors did not always work, it was annoying.
When checking in early, more details about how to access level 5 where the complimentary lounge is located and where the lifts are to access it  would be helpful. Executive lounge Stayed in January 2020"

927,Grand Copthorne Waterfront,4.0,“ Perhaps I expected too much ! ”,"Cleanliness. So dusty everywhere in the bedroom, bathroom is full of black mold!! And at the main entrance, glass roof top and windows are lack of cleaning and so dirty that sunlight cannot  pass through fully.  Yellow stained glassdoor at the entrance makes the lobby so dark .. no one cares about all the little details in small things what a 5 star hotel, they claimed to be, should be .. only 3 stars or less delivery in my opinion .. on the first night, I couldn’t sleep because my room is full of black mold which it was hidden by wallpaper which is badly done. And a light without a switch was brightly shined on my face. I didn’t take a shower despite a long journey,  because the bathroom was so dirty !!! Black mold between tiles, glass panel silicone sealing, the glass door hinches and along the wall skirting .. it is a room full of health hazzrads ! Even on the air con vent ! I had a room changed the next day, the room was better than the first one but it was still so poorly maintained .. this upset me so much!  Then the wedding banquet room.. it was so dirty on the floor, and so messy .. I am so sorry for what the wedding couples have  to pay .. understood that  casual labours are hard to find, but they all should be better trained in banquet serving, becauee its someone’s wedding !! Its big deal !! Perhaps should remove that stand at your front desk, the award for 5 stars hotel !! Or, May be I was in bad luck!! Doorman and Susan from front office are the two best faces at the front of the hotel.  Susan has demonstrated a professionalism what a 5 stars hotel guest deserved!  She is sympathetic, efficient and very profesional.  She is good to all her guests ! She did beyond what an FO has to do .. I hope the hotel will cherish this invaluable emplyee and further her career  to the next higher level .. The city view is great from the high floor. The buffet looked good. The area outside the hotel is very nice for walking around.  Pizzas at the italian restaurant, Grassini, was very good and tasty, thin and crispy base. But pasta was a bit disappointed, room guests get 30% off which is great for value. Stayed in October 2019"

992,Hotel Boss,8.0,Very Good,"The breakfast was adequate but was an odd mixture of Chinese, Indian, and American foods, with nothing quite hitting the spot. I would have like more fruit options and more protein choices. The room was smaller than we expected, though it did  have everything we needed. We also had a large balcony but it only offered a view of other rooms/balconies. The location was amazing, very convenient to public transit and easily walkable to different places we wanted to see, along with multiple food options.

1042,Hotel Boss,6.7,Pleasant,At check in I was told I had to pay. But I paid 2 months ago as proved by my Credit Card statement and I also showed them my Booking.com Confirmation of Full payment on my phone. They insisted on one night payment (a “deposit”) then said I cant pay by credit card. I had no cash so they wanted my passport! I had argument with Manager who finally checked me in.

Next time i prefer a cheaper accomodation. This hotel is a friendly and clean accomodation, built in modern style. Easy to find (next to Lavender MRS). More attractions below 1 km by walk. If you prefer only sleep it's enough. Every day you got 1 or 2 bottle of 0.5l water, and filled with coffe/tea bags. If your room is near in the highest floor, you get a lovely view to the city.

The breakfast is very average. The restaurant is more like an industrial canteen, with plastic crockery and glassware. Staff were generally rather grumpy and certainly did not make one feel welcome or that they were happy to have you. Although they have tried to make the hotel look higher end, it is actually just a basic needs entry level hotel. The property is in a good location close to most tourist attractions and an MRT station. Stayed in October 2022"
1151,Hotel Boss,5.0,“ Small and claustrophobic room. ”,"The room was absolutely tiny. The space between the desk and the bed was so small, I could barely pull the chair out far enough to sit down. The toilet was lodged hard up against the side of the shower screen - very uncomfortable and difficult to use. The room was suitable for a tiny person only. The room is only cleaned/serviced every 2 days - not every day, as normal. Therefore, things like water and tea/coffee are only topped up every 2 days. I didn't see this when I was booking. Location was good as far as access to local shops and restaurants was concerned. Good drop-off point for taxis - though often very busy. The staff at check-in were very helpful and informative. Stayed in October 2022"
1152,Hotel Boss,3.0,“ Dorminatry and nothing else!! ”,"i didn't like almost everything about this place.
absolutely shockingly Small in almost every aspect. it is very fancy outside with no substance inside.
the concierge did not even tried to great us or help with luggage. There were so many people in reception that you felt as another small fish in the tank. We were greeted by reception staff that just followed ""the book"" and protocol to check us in and move to the next guest
Rooms are shockingly small and all photography has been done with wide lenses and marking purposes.
when you are in the room and the bag is on the floor to take things out (note- there is no other place for it at all anyway) you need to jump over the bag to get to your bed.
It's a shocker for the amount of money they charge.
as i wrote a review on a trip advisor, i missed a few key signs in the first place:
why would a good hotel put a photo of laundry in the featured photos??!!
I have been asked to pay in full for the whole stay at check in!! what it means to us is that it's a point of no return - you can't check out after the first ruined night and move to another place.
the third one - watch for the hangers in the room above the TV !! the rooms are so ""practical"" that there is no space for a wardrobe!
before checking I sent some messages - there was no reply either.
The bathroom is so small that there is no space to put a toilet paper roll, and there is NO Toilet paper at all. There are  paper tissues somewhere above your head.
Also, you can forget about sitting on the toilet normally!! - there is no space to put your leg normally - the show glass is next to the seat.!
if you get an internal corner room, you will face another window 2 meters away from another hotel room, and if you're not feeling yourself already in the prison and want to look outside, you will see reflection of yourself which is not limited to your own but also reflections or views of all your neighbours across multiple floors .. Tell you honestly there was nothing to like about it except location .,.. sorry. Stayed in September 2022"

The manager / staff at the reception was also super rude and said they don't clean rooms everyday!!

Due to tapping our card to check the options (which were nonexistent), they proceeded to argue about charging us 40 dollars, despite stating our argument multiple times. Pathetic service.... Pathetic food... Very small rooms... Absolute waste. Rooms did not get cleaned daily and even it was cleaned done poorly. No change of linen..... very bad hotel experience for a 4Star hotel.

But unfortunately in my booking the breakfast wasn't included and there was no option in the booking so i presumed this was included in the cost until i arrived and went for breakfast the next day. Totally disappointed as had to pay a big amount for breakfast for x 4 during my stay
The breakfast was not worth the amount I paid for as could have few more choices included
Secondly The rooms were not sound proof as I  could hear the next door neighbour shouting and celebrating late night or early morning until 0400  specially after me having tiring days
Lastly the air con and TV in the room was useless. Had to report few times until the TV got sorted and air con never  
Overall an okay stay as was out most of the days

Of course on the 2nd day I asked for it to be cleaned. But it looks like they just made the bed and changed the bath towels, while the dirty glasses were not washed and the floor of the room was still dirty and dusty. On the 3rd day I tried to complain to the front office and asked them to re-clean but they didn't want to because management policy only cleaned the room every 2 days. Finally on the 4th day they just cleaned my room. Actually I wouldn't mind if they cleaned my room well, the problem is they only want to clean every 2 days and even then in my opinion the cleanliness is not up to the standard of a 4 star hotel. Please clean the room every day, include the dirty cups and floor Stayed in July 2022"

The policy didn't provide enough support to be able to clean the room everyday. it's not a good sign during the continued rising of COVID cases in Singapore.

The tissue quality was bad, shower pressure was high and shower head couldnt stay on the holder. The room had a balcony which had a sticky stain on the floor causing us the inconvenience of having to wear out slippers whenever we needed to go into the balcony. There was no bedroom slippers available. The YOUTUBE was not playing smoothly and it disrupted our entertainment plans to have a sing along session.  We anticipated fun time at the pool, but the minute i went in wearing my goggles, I could see so much of impurities floating in the water. It was a disgusting sight to see clumps of hair floating in the water as well. The water was so cloudy and after a while we saw a cleaner using a nets to fish the impurities out of the pool. Could he have cleaned the whole pool using the net? And he was cleaning the pool while guests were still swimming. It was very disgusting. I will never choose to return back to this hotel. The hygiene and cleanliness despite covid season is very bad. I am utterly disappointed that tourist will have to see and compare the state of a hotel in Singapore. We should be proud of our hotels but this experience ruined my staycation mood. It would be good to have the management call me over a chat about the cleanliness.

First of all, the room has really bad smoking 🚬 kind of smell when we first enter, although it says smoking is prohibited, but the smell was really bad.
Secondly, the wall had some kind of stains which is really not comfortable to see.
Thirdly, the room light was not so good, it's quite dim.
Fourthly, the most important part, the water ! The hot water was not flowing well and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. And the worst part is the water pressure was very small, sometimes strong, truly bad experience.
Lastly upon checkout, we requested concierge to help our bags to be brought down, they said their guys were busy and if I wanted to wait, I must wait 30 to 40mins. Such a shame.
Never ever comeback to this hotel. Sorry, first and last.

1397,Hotel Boss,5.0,“ disappointing and not what we expected ”,"Sadly, the day that we arrived we got to our family room and it was disgusting. Within 5 minutes of being there all of our feet were black, which my little ones quickly transferred to the white bedding when they jumped on them, the floor clearly hadn't been washed for some time. Our first night, the Wi-Fi went down and we were unable to watch TV or use tablets etc. Not usually an issue, but when travelling with small children, something to keep them settled is a must - especially when there is no space in the room itself to play! We reported the Wi-Fi issue the next day, sadly we were told this couldn't be fixed and so the next morning we had to move rooms. (also quite annoying when you have already unpacked for 4 people). I did complain to the manager about the dirty room, no Wi-Fi and having to move - to which i was offered complimentary late checkout for our stay for the inconvenience which I appreciated very much. Our second room Wi-Fi wasn't great, but it was better for the majority of the time. We did not have a cleaner come in daily to re stock on water, coffee etc. and so had to call and request these to be brought to us (twice), which is another disappointing factor as I would expect this to be completed daily given the price we paid. Lastly, if you want to iron your clothing you will need to travel to the 4th floor where the pool is located. These are not provided or supplied in your rooms, I suspect because there is not enough space. The location was brilliant, very close to underground and bus stops, central location and very easy to get around. Lots of cute little pubs and cafes for food nearby. Easy walk to the local shopping mall as well. The entrance and lobby were beautifully decorated.The pool and playground on site were great for the kiddos, although the park is more suited for toddlers, I would say no child over 4/5 could really make much use of it. The gym area is very small, but still does what it promises.Staff were friendly and helpful during the unfortunate situations where we did feel the need to complain.

1446,Hotel Boss,2.0,“ My stay on 24 Dec for Xmas ”,"I have requested for disposable cutleries for my family and was told to collect from the reception. I went down and a grab driver was infront of me. He was queuing to pass the food to the staff and I am just curious that is this the right thing for the hotel staff to order food and make the grab driver queue in front of your guest? Secondly, when I asked from the staff for the disposable cutleries, her attitude was bad and was unfriendly to me. 
Lastly, after checking out, we placed our luggages with your concierge and went for lunch... we were being given 1 tag for 3 bags. Upon returning from our lunch, we wanted to collect our bags but were being told by the staff that we should have 3 tags. We were stunned and informed him that we only have 1 tag and he was not willing to release our bags to us...and keep on saying that we should have 3 bags. May I know what kind of attitude is this and is it our fault that we do not have 3 tags and how do we know we need to have 3 tags and the staff who was the one who gave us 1 tag in the initial part? Our bags were being bundled together as well. 
I want an explanation on this as the staff questioned us on the retrieving of our bags and his attitude was bad. Thank you. The location of the hotel is good, near to MRT and lots of eateries near it. Stayed in December 2020"

Despite being impressed with the waiting time, it brought to my disappointment that
1) hotel staff over the counter were too monotonous 
2) hotel room wasn’t well cleaned 
3) there was plastic and chopsticks from the past guest before us that were not clear at the time when we check in our room
4) there was a some water in the kettle
5) floor wasn’t vacuum or mop as there was some sands around it
I stayed over March this year and was happy with the place at that time with the room and amenities as well as the staff however the 2nd time i stayed there (although just for 1 night) the standard drop a lot. 
I could’ve took some photo for evidence and then i think again, i will not come back to this hotel for the third time onwards anymore.
Nevertheless, location is pretty much convenient to malls and food place around there.
Hope Hotel Boss bring back its standard like before.

1542,Hotel Boss,3.3,“ NEVER at HOTEL BOSS ”,"We have booked for 3days 2 nights . My entire stay was HORRENDOUS!! My room was extremely dirty and I was charged for over sgd250 for a tiny miserable room. Upon checking in, the staff was also laughing at me for overpaying extra of $120 for that small room!! 
And I asked for more water, they didnt want to supply , telling us to go down 7/11 to buy. That price I paid for , I should have gone to Hotel Intercontinental!!!! I have picked that place as it was near to town. 
The room was dirty with hair and dust all over.
The bed was very as hard as a plank, like sleeping on the floor waking up with body aches. Only 2 small pillows for us. HUGE booking disaster with booking.com!!! None! Stayed in January 2020"

1546,Hotel Boss,3.0,Poor,"The hotel is basically overwhelmed with the large number of guests. There is no service existing for and at the guest. The breakfast is not varied and the equipment is getting old and outdated. The published photos of the hotel in the internet do not correspond to reality in any way. In truth, the room was small, uncomfortable and the furnishings did not invite to relax. The cleanliness of the hotel room is positive. Stayed in January 2020"
1547,Hotel Boss,4.6,Disappointing,"Very small rooms. Not enough space .
No wardrobe to hang our cloths.Hanging cloths without a wardrobe is very unpleasant.
Safe box is also cheap one always give trouble.
They didn’t change our linen for entire 10 days.
Room service is very poor . Very difficult to get even  a water bottle since our water bottles are finished and even in the morning we are entitle water bottles .
Very poor breakfast . Same budget b’fast for 10 days . Finally we stoped going there for b’fast.
Staff used to bring waste food trolly just next to our table when we are having meals . We were really disturbed when we see waste food , uncleaned plates and cutlery next to our face when we are having meals . They may have done it to serve labour force , but after paying large sum of money for 10 days , i am really disappointed the things they are doing for cost-cutting.

Even though we couldn't get a family room the hotel managed to put our 2 standard rooms next to each other.
