1,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,hotels favourite gcw turned my qo into a staycayvacay what a wonderful experience trashing my initial thoughts of how to cope with being imprisoned all be it even at a star hotel the moment i arrived at am on the th june was a breeze with courtesy received entering the room was a relief with spacious very clean and well equipt with neccesities the bed and pillows were very comfortable the view gave me the serenity needed for this situation as it faces the singapore river and city view even batam can be seen on a clear day very good wifi connection helps keep my sanity intact most of all what was more stunning was the great guest oriented hotel personnel which truly was amazing and what guests always expected nomatter what the situation or reason to stay can be i must humbly commend them for making mine a pleasantly memorable one to jiun lee and cheryl from one touch for keeping me company with their friendly and sincerity i can feel just over our daily telephone conversations and i was very pleasantly surprised that them knowing im a bts army presented me with an encouragement greeting card with bts poster print now that was awesome liya hope i spelt it correctly from the same department was enthusiastic when we spoke on my checking out day to all of you gamsahamidah to gcw hotel manager mr terence ng my sincere appreciation for taking good care of me in making my stay trouble and stress free you have a great team to kelvin whom i met briefly at the lobby upon my departure i appreciate your courtesy to everyone from housekeeping in room dining to certis cisco the moh i thank you all very much from the bottom of my heart grand corpthorne waterfront you are indeed fantabulously grand
2,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,excellent hotel and staff this is our fourth stay at this hotel in the past years and we are very happy to return again and again apart from a couple of really minor issues with the room and a failed poolside drinks order only once i cannot fault it the staff are extremely friendly and helpful especially shirley jennifer and kenneth on the club level th floor the pool is nice but was much busier this year we think because of the increased popularity of formula one now the food at tempo was very good indeed and the bar staff very attentive and friendly my only wish is that the bar would stay open later the breakfast selection certainly caters for a wide range of cultures and was very good thank you for a wonderful stay
3,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,overcharged be careful we stayed for nights from new zealand to visit our new grand daughter and were incorrectly charged for and now after numerous emails requesting they refund us for their mistake we have had to lodge a dispute with amex to get our money backwe actually checked out at front counter and they said they would email our account and once we didnt receive it checked our card on return to new zealand they were clearly short staffed as long queues at reception so someone has made a mistake at reception our room also smelled damp and of some chemical and we so bad we had to request a room change as it was extremely pungent we operate a resort ourselves and i am absolutely gobsmacked that a hotel of this size operates in such a poor and unprofessional manner we will eventually get our money back via amex needless to say i would warn anyone contemplating staying here to book elsewhere
4,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,needs a refurb and a bar that stays open past we stayed here for the f weekend and to visit our son in singapore as it was a busy weekend the choices of hotels was limited we were allocated a room which smelled of damp and soon as we opened the door severe evidence on the corner wall and the lampshade in room even outside the room the hall carpet was smelly and obviously had some sort of leakage personal accident we were quickly allocated another room it is in need of a serious refurb decoration and furniture was in poor condition not sure why it wasnt done during lockdown it did have a great view though during the f weekend the bar closed one night and the next night for a supposed international hotel it was a joke on the plus side the doormen for fabulous and very attentive this is supposed to be a hotel but was more like a i do not recommend staying here
5,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,service with a smile rooms are slightly run down quite surprised they didnt renovate during the lock down period but the attitude and services of the staff there reminded me why it was a star had such a great experience at the level executive club where staff indulge us in beverages and food held a conversation with us
6,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,grandcopthorne clean and staff were fantastic a bit far from the city but will be better once new train station opposite opens the company that owns the hotel lacks integrity and transferred our booking and overcharged us for our room i wont stay in one of theyre hotels again
7,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,average hotel but ok very over priced hotel but it was the racing weekend but even so too expensive clean and tidy rooms polite staff location not great but easy to get a taxi concierge was disappointing as when i arrived with luggage i wasnt welcomed or helped to my room with my luggage i had to take it up on my own

11,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,low level star hotel tired and old decor good location i stayed here for nights last week i was a lil concerned due to recent reviews but to be honest i thought it would be worse that what i experienced the check in process was ok i was expecting a disaster as i got a checkin email asking what time i would arrive and a time slot option i should pick as there were many ppl expected the first time ive received anything like this from all of my travels the rooms were a bit disappointing old carpet the type you dont want to walk on with wet feet deliberately darker colored the shower was pretty bad looked like it hasnt been upgraded since the s the location of the hotel is its best feature close to henderson and clark quay and all of the bars coffee shops restaurants etc the breakfast was
12,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,one night stay very impressive hotel when viewed externally upon arrival room was small and starting to show its age definitely time for some refresh renovations staff were good but the reservation desk seemed to take a lot of key strokes and a bit of time on check in
13,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,good location good location for a business trip to access all but no restaurant around the hotel the price was a little higher due to f racing i think there is no shopping center or restaurant nearby so it is not a good location to go out late in the evening so its not good for tourists but i want to recommend it to business travelers
14,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,best service experience ever a big thanks to your excellent lounge team shirley jenifer kenneth n also to your night managerrodney shirley is just amazing in word her colleague jennifer a beautiful sweet lady took good care of us when we came for evening cocktail kenneth a friendly gentleman made sure we were comfortable n wellserved at all times we enjoyed some really nice cold beer service at the lounge is a top notch and rodney hes so accommodating n a very nice boy addressed to all our needs in the middle of the night we were really moved as he made our long hard days so much better i was taken aback when told by of the bell captain that he is the night managerbecause he has got the look of a kid who will never grow up very adorablenot an insult but rather a compliment the
15,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,family vacation pleasant stay i would say overall i truly enjoyed the stay during my trip to singapore although the hotel has its flaws i received excellent service especially from rodney who perfectly handled my complaint regarding the room he responded quickly and gave my family and i a great solution which made my stay at this hotel even more memorable frankly speaking id only wanted to rate this hotel to stars due to the poor condition of the room but after how calmly and tactfully rodney handled my complaint i decided to give you guys stars
16,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,shirley chng is simply the best i had a terrible time in singapore until i met shirley chng i moved hotels twice from top hotels came to copthorne to move away from f congestion i can honestly say she is simply amazing effective and made our stay absolutely perfect in every possible way
17,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,poor condition and cleanliness of rooms hotel rooms are apparently due a refurbishment in october however the current rooms are very run down and most disappointingly unclean and full of dust issues noted during last stay dusty rooms floor has not been dusted enough despite whatever sg clean standard is meant to be ripped furniture leather and cloth covering on chairs mould on sink joining to the basin rusty water sprinklers stains on furniture including bed frame and desk badly in need of a refresh and actually maintaining cleanliness standards staff are friendly and professional just let down by the current standards of the rooms at current prices and positioning as a star hotel you are probably better off findind something else in singapore
18,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,good stay for vaiue for what you pay it was a very valuable stay with great amenities and service checkin and departure was a seamless process and the stay was enjoyable with good proximity to key areas in singapore only area for improvement i suggest is knowing when the staff will come in to clean my bedsheets didnt seem like they were new ones more so just tidied
19,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,hidden gem rooms were spacious staff very efficient and courteous breakfast was scrumptious and hotel is conveniently located near bus stops etc it would have been nice if we had river views but overall all good
20,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,great location and facilities great location as it is central to everything facilities are great and the restaurant has a great choice of food to suit everyone all staff were excellent especially as the hotel was extremely busy which was nice to see
21,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,fake star hotel i dont know how this hotel is rated star we arrived at pm and no one came to pick our luggage from the taxi we were ok fine then they gave us a twin room smaller than the one we already booked and paid for because there was the big one was not available and they will move us to the bigger room in the morning and this without a compensation then the worst thing which is the room itself just have a look at the pics and you be the judge i would never book this hotel to any one its like paying for star hotel and getting star experience

28,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,thank you for the hospitality my family and i stayed for a few nights during the september school holidays and had a brief but lovely respite from work well like to credit the people who made that possible foremost we want to thank kenneth for his exceptional service he arranged meticulously for detailed room tours before the stay the most hasslefree checkin and out room upgrade as well as dining reservations i have to say he met our needs and wants very well a testament to his keen observation of our preferences theres more to thank him for but i think it suffices to say we are impressed by his understated excellence and with him we always feel that were in good hands the service and offerings at the club lounge was the highlight of the stay not only was the view most inviting but
29,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,holiday by the river great location lovely hotel with friendly staff easy walk to riverside restaurants close to main attractions with a bus stop at the door beautiful city view from our th floor room we will stay here again
30,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,nice hotel but nothing stood out i booked a night stay at the grand copthorne waterfront hotel and i had a pleasant stay the staff were friendly and helpful a few things that were minor inconveniences i had one outlet that i could plug my adapterdevices in luckily it had two usb plugs so i could charge devices at once one of the four curtain handles were missing but i didnt care too much as it was much easier to open and close the curtain with my hand the shower door wouldnt close all the way properly so the door would be slightly ajar during a shower the closet door would not slide shut all the way and so i used a slippersock in between the cracks of the two doors to keep one of the doors shut the location is not the greatest but it does give you a nice view of the river which is also
31,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great service me and my partner were greeted with smiles and great service at the executive lounge and overall we were pleased with everything that grand copthorne waterfront had offered us even gave us a free upgrade to a suite thank you for the memorable experience
32,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,still an excellent hotel i have stayed at the grand copthorne many time for business when i travel through singapore the staff are very friendly and helpful and i have enjoyed upgrades to the clubs suites on several occasions the club lounge is an ideal oasis for relaxing or getting some work done in a quiet and peaceful environment
33,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,average wouldnt call this a star hotel we booked grand copthorne as part of our honeymoon stay in singapore first of all i would just like to say by no means is this a star i would rate it a at best the bathroom was pretty dingy considering sinks were cracked in our room a very comfortable bed however staff were relatively pleasant however considering we had mentioned it was our honeymoon there were no special treatment services given not even a simple towel decoration this was the first stop of our multi destination and copthorne were the only hotel who i would say didnt make us feel special or even congratulate us on our newlywed status not a huge deal but wouldve started our honeymoon off in a nice way location is very strange no close amenities there is a mall thats min walk away
34,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great stay in the heart of city excellent location and a great clean friendly hotel grand copthorne waterfront is ideally located in a classic part of singapore on the riverfront and very near to business district as well as tourist hotspots there is a shopping mall great world city right next to it
35,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,good the next will stay in creature comforts when singapore trip especially my room she was using is really good room in addition her daughters more convenient to do the event at hotels such as the graduation ceremony can use the good you will have a better image of the hotel if you get the statement and deposit back

39,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,disappointment we always loved staying at the hotel as we were always welcome by the staff concierge team to club lounge team however during our recent short stay earlier this month it has left us a sour feeling we are prestige member of my millennium and we were being upgraded to club deluxe room courtesy of club manager ms s things took a downward spiral fast shortly after checking in we went to the club lounge for some light refreshment drinks and upon stepping out from the lift ms j asked how can i help you whereas ms s welcome in different treatments we let it slide as it wasnt a big deal now on checking out this is where it all begin ms j kept on harping we havent paid for the room when it was all being paid when we booked the hotel then mentioned we

42,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,grand copthorne waterfront stay hotel is catering mostly to group tours its really not geared to the independent traveler the location is good but food and beverage facilities are limited the lobby feels like a railway station with lots of group tour guests running around and there is no feeling of being in a pleasant and classy hotel lobby

91,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,stay in connecting rooms deluxe and single this was a second staycation post covid this time i arrived earlier for checkin and did echeckin the waiting and processing was so much better highly recommend anyone to do echeck in first for both staycations i was wowed by the service of the staff at both the reception as well as in the restaurant tip as the housekeeping staff are mainly migrant workers it would help them to understand your needs better if you are able to speak their native language instead of english however they are very courteous and willing to help room wise decent size but decor is dated as this property is pretty old do expect some signs of aging in the room facilities however bed and pillows are firm enough for a good nights sleep depending on your luck the temperature
92,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,good stay yes it needs a refurb in some areas but it was still a great place to stay clean good breakfast buffet friendly and helpful staff good views from riverside room and good outdoor seating area for the bar and eating
93,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,star maybe years ago we stayed at this hotel as we were moved from our original booking as they were now being used as a quarantine hotel we were still excited to stay here to end our day holiday as the pictures of the room looked good and it was our negative experience started when we tried to check in minutes we had to wait while one person was on the desk trying to sort check in and manage guest complaints at a peak time when we finally got to our room we were overcome with disappointment the smell the decor the old tv and the watermarked ceiling greeted us neither of us wanted to take our shoes off as the room felt dirty i then spotted the note on the bed about being eco and changing the sheets this was absolutely filthy covered in coffee stains and just pure dirt this was
94,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,singapore trip stay at grand copthorne waterfront was excellent rooms were clean facilities well maintained javin at the front desk and vincent were very helpful the view of the city from our room was spectacular only complaint kitchen closes at but definitely recommended for stay
95,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,not a hotel for early checkin or early check out we had problems trying to check an early checkin where the listed price on the website changed to over double the price when i phoned to see if i could get a confirmation for the early checkin early check out was a disaster with the breakfast arriving minutes late bathrooms are small and the sink flooded the vanity surface every time it was turned on limescale build up in the shower wasnt good
96,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,customer service is superb i have stayed here for almost weeks and i must say that i have enjoyed my stay because of their amazing customer service to their guest the filipino concierge named paul is always accommodating and kind especially the bartenders sandy castillo karlo torres yuslizanmanor brian and to their managers sivan and the rest they have provided us first class customer service and making us feel at home they are professional friendly and nice service crew they never make you feel that you are asking too much friendly service crew like them makes your trip extra pleasant thank you guys i would definitely recommend this hotel it is also near the major places like ion orchard wisma clarke quay etc and if i will travel to singapore again i will deffo stay in this hotel
97,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,comfort relaxation to get the negativity out of the way first the grand copthorne waterfront hotel has got quite tired in their rooms but still very comfortable the tv sets definitely require new ones to be placed in all the rooms if ours was anything to go by as the sound was terrible and picture was as bad the positives outweigh the negatives because the food was good and the canapés in the club lounge were a delight beds were very comfortable especially the pillows and rooms were lovely and clean views from our room were spectacular looking out to the river and marina bay but most of all shirley club manager and her two club executives kenneth jennifer were as good a hosts as you will ever meet they went out of their way to make us feel at home as we have visited this hotel
98,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,good service we had our rom ceremony in grand copthorne waterfront upon checked in ms shirley and the team assist me closely and ensure our stay is comfortable and our request are all promptly delivered really thank you so much for your help really appreciate it on the side note ms shirley and her team also prepared cake for us as a welcome gift very nice gesture well done
99,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,great location friendly staff good facilities needs from tlc i have stayed here a number of times primarily for business my last trip i also had my wife and daughter travelling with me the hotel is in a great location close to restaurants the river walk and shopping centres it has all the facilities you need gym swimming pool and good restaurant options the staff are friendly and always willing to help the only negative to highlight is that the rooms really need a good update
100,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,wonderful stay with a touch of luxury we a family of three had a stay at grand copthorne waterfront hotel we booked a stay at a club floor and it was one of the best choices we have made shirley the club manager and alex club executive were really kind and caring the food was great we spent three evenings and every evening there was different menu interesting and tasty wine was delicious and there was a variety of coctails i would really like to repeat the experience and reccommend it to the others
101,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,stay from th to the th of aug i sincerely hope that the hotel makes more effort in encouraging guests to wear and put on their masks properly at the lobby at the buffet breakfast and also in the lift there were many guests who could not be bothered to wear their masks we needed to do a pcr test before we can board our flights to hong kong and we really had the fear of catching covid at your property there was even a used mask found in our room after we told the front desk to clean our room well
102,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great hospitality booked the executive suite to celebrate my moms bday shirley the club manager and her colleague jennifer gave us the best hospitality we were given an upgrade to the la residenza bed room serviced suite my parents really enjoyed the stay there thumbs up for their service definitely recommended thanks shirley

108,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,very rude noncooperative staff ambiance was fine but the staff was very rude no adequate service was provided people lack compassion and empathy really need to work on their social skills ill mannerism was personified by the staff at every interaction
109,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,not a star property not a star property i checkedin to this hotel with some trepidation after reading the reviews the checkin was smooth but that was where the good things came to a halt the lobby has a dated looking light installation the furniture in the lobby area need to be reupholstered there is an atm money exchange convenience store onsite so thats helpful the room was small and did not resemble the hotel website pics at all the bathroom had mould in the sink and shower areas the toiletries were substandard to come back to my room after every outing felt like a punishment the aircon system worked fine the staff at the coffee shop and bar were helpful even with a long overdue renovation in the pipeline for guests who had to stay in this hotel under such poor room conditions i felt cheated
110,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,business trip i am a frequent traveller and my favourite hotel is the grand copthorne waterfront for a very important reason the excellent club manager shirley chng and her excellent club team provide excellent service and never fail to make me feel at home
111,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,service mindset and cleanliness for star hotels overall i was satisfied with the hotels condition but the bathroom cleaning was not good enough and some staff were a bit unkind the breakfast was excellent for the price and i think the room is in low condition to be star
112,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,horrible service if i could give this hotel a big fat zero i would dropped them an email with a feedback it has been more than a week and still no replies so im posting this here hoping to get their attention my husband booked a room on the club floor for my birthday on july front desk greeting room decor and card all said happy anniversary but thats fine mistakes happen eventually the straw that broke the camels back was the service or the lack thereof we received from jennifer who was manning the counter at the club floor the next day at around pm when we approached her i politely asked if we could check out she took in a veryyyyyy deep breath and sighed yes you read that right sighed before saying yes without even looking at us had it not been
113,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,staycation excellent service during our stay in the hotel club manager shirley and club executive kenneth did a wonderful job when we visited the lounge and also provide us help during our stay in the hotel
114,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,wonderful club experience we had a fantastic time in the club lounge with the impeccable service from the club executives as well as the club manager shirley while pending for the ndp fireworks display the lights in the lounge were intentionally switched off to create an excellent ambience for the guests good quality of food and snacks coupled with the high service standard the entire club experience was outstanding

119,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,pleasant experience for a night booked for the view to watch national day managed to get a great view at the lounge with amazing food and beverage served by shirley jennifer and kenneth the room is clean and acceptable however it needs a renovation to replace the tv old furnitures and dirty parts overall it is considered as stars instead of stars
120,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,club room service great arriving at check in looks so grandbut will say executive club room disappointed yes very large but shower leaked onto carpet so it was wet near doorhouse keeping needs a bit of a shake up as the room very dusty and needs a good clean club lounge was excellent shirleyjennifer and kenneth were great could not do more for you our overall stay was good
121,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,disappointed this stay disappointed this stay have previously stayed in a club room so expectations may have been too high as we just had a superior room this stay the main disappointment was the cleanliness i dont usually check detail but i lost the back off my earring and while searching the floor was not impressed with the amount of fluff and dirt the staff were all helpful but i wouldnt say outstanding i found the breakfast items to be on the cold side and with only chef on the egg station it was easier to avoid the line i must commend assistance with late departure it was great to store luggage and be able to use the pool facilities to shower before our flight thankyou if i was to stay again i would go for a club room as we had wonderful service last time
122,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,good and friendly service excellent service from the staff and met all the requirements we required as we are with our newborn clean clean and with great amenities close to shops restaurant and bar fantastic singapore river view

128,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,great position we stayed nights at the grand copthorne and originally booked a king room and decided when we arrived to upgrade to a deluxe king room only because we were told they were bigger and more suitable for an day stay the upgrade was granted for an extra fee of which we accepted being put in an old deluxe king room was disappointing to say the least old carpets and skirting boards that havent been cleaned for many years were spotted straight away with the all black marble shower and finding the black door stop on the shower floor was dangerous another room was asked for and it was a newer room cleaner and simply had been repainted new carpet and wall decorations so much betterthe hotel itself has great breakfast suiting all nationalities clean foya area and sits

132,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,if youre looking for a disappointment this hotel needs a facelift was not given what we reserved on our confirmation hotel forced us to move to a sister hotel due to corporate issues at original property without any being compensated in addition we were forced into a room with twins instead of a king bed

139,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,grand cothorne waterfront singapore the worst travel experience i have ever had bad experience total disappointment the room had no windows to be opened bad smell in the room when i asked to change my room to one with a windowthat opensthe hotel receptionist said i should add for nights to upgrade my room couldnt imagine so farthat you have to pay to get fresh air it was impossible to sleep during the nightno fresh airfelt like being in a cell breakfast alsoleaves much to be desired they charge huge rates for poor quality service
140,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,bad experience terrible experience with bar manager on the evening of friday july worst customer service i have ever experienced really poor customer service and really poor and unprofessional behavior including yelling at staff in front of customers based on this experience our organization will not stay in this hotel ever again more details can be found in the review
141,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,food capital durian fiesta excellent food with friendly staffs doris and the rest of the staffs were attentive and nice stars service nice durians was served and the seafood are fresh wide selections were provided not to forget the quiet and nice atmosphere we also requested for a table by the window for mini celebration our requested was fulfilled it was a wonderful experience thank you good job guys

145,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,javin is very good person this hotel is very nice and very convenient because mr javin here staff like these treat like a home and not a customerand room is very clean we want come againwith my family friends thanks
146,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,convenient location we stayed in this hotel for nights in may this year and we are a family of four it has all the amenities one needs and is neat and clean the beds are very comfortable we slept well each night i would highly recommend it for its location as it has many eateries in clarke quay within walking distance there is a seven eleven nearby too we loved walking along the river and experience the buzz and the nightlife around we took cabs mainly so didnt use any other public transport the hotel does have a bus stand nearby to get around it is close to most of the sights and areas of interest in singapore the boat cruise station is also walking distance from this hotel about mins the reviews for this hotel mentioned a lot about the breakfast and we were not expecting much
147,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,breakfast is good bathroom shower floor really need a not so slippery tile although you have provide us with the rubber anti slip map knowing the hotel is going to have a revamp soon and hopefully the next time when i visit stay in the hotel it will be a more modern and hip room buffet breakfast is good though most hotel guest might not need to use the car park but that does not mean you can use it as a store for unused furniture
148,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,very polite staff we stayed here for weeks and have come across fellow filipino staff who took good care of us while staying here generally everyone is polite and professional food selection at the buffet is good too
149,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,most horrible hotel in south east asia with poor front desk service attached poor guest services and even poorer hotel the hotel is far from being the stars advertised it is at a maximum stars the rooms are advertised as being five stars however we had to request another room because the room is smelly the second room given is not better the sink has humidity spots and is glued the furniture has serious cracks and the service at the front desk is poor the only helpful person here was the maid who brought few extra towels in the room the hotel manager on duty cant be contacted for complaints you have to relay the feedback to a phone operator who will give it to the front desk to be burried somewhere and this is just the first half an hour definitely the worst hotel we lived in south east asia not worth it not recommended and
150,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,birthday lunch wonderful service from sally n ibrahim very helpful n friendly went above n beyond to make my cousin brthday lunch special been dining here since they opened n the special care has never wavered many thanks again
151,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great service at lounge got the top floor room for our booking lovely view despite dated was decently maintained had club lounge access went for evening drinks and bites awesome and lovely service by shirley and kenneth very proactive and friendly and helpful service
152,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,shocking we were given a room that was filthy and mouldy the carpets were disgusting under the bed there was at least months of dust the fridge was filthy the smell from the very mouldy bathroom ceiling was eye watering after waiting hours we were given another room that was not great for this quality hotel you would expect a stocked bar fridge breakfast was hit and miss maybe the worst we have encountered in the last years of travelling the meal service in the hotel is very poor when ordering a main meal or snack they came out staggered so when one had finished eating the other meal would arrive on our last evening there we noticed the theme board for drink and meal promotions was actually out side the hotel which was a well kept secret it would have been
153,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,fantastic modern hotel in a great location fantastic clean and modern hotel great location walking distance to all the attractions breakfast was varied with lots of options for every taste and excellent quality concierge was very helpful in advising us what to see and do and make the best of our time would definitely recommend
154,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great hotel with good management at first we were nervous but the gm mr gagan and reception staff were very cooperative my recommendation is pay extra for the th floor without the club lounge as rooms are very spacious with a bath tub good breakfast options and check in takes time but if we check in online its quick they should have a separate line for pre registered guests
155,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,a recent visit generally a very good hotel it had good value for money especially considering that most good hotels in singapore are very expensive access to clarke quay which had a vibrant night life was easy unfortunately transport tofrom the hotel was hindered by the need to call for taxis or ubers the mrt station across the road was not operational the mrt connectivity should improve when this station is opened
156,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,good value pros overall i liked my stay at the hotel good service and good sized rooms the breakfast buffet was of good value it appears as if the hotel is near the mass transit lines its easy to get to the pedestrian ridge to access the waterfront restaurants i recommend this hotel cons i had to spend my last night in singapore at another hotel this was my fault
157,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,hotel room with view of singapore river stayed in bedroom hotel room which had very nice view of singapore river despite delay in room checkin hotel front desk staff halim was friendly and helpful to ensure we were comfortably seated at tempo fb outlet whilst we wait

162,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,worst experienced stay ever as a wedding couple is our wedding day given a comp stay for nights at here by our hotel banquet due to shn on my husband left a necklace thailand gold which mil bought for him as a wedding gift on the dressing table with a box and my pack bag trusted that it will not go missing we went out in the noon housekeeping came to clean up our room came back to the roomm and my husband realised it was missing he quickly head over yo reception to inform fo the fo on night shift told my husband he will get back to us in the morning in the morning after having breakfast still no news from fo so my husband head down to reception again another fo told him that he will update us before check out now after check out and spoke to this duty manager karen she did what she did
163,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,postwedding staycation we held our wedding at the hotel in jan and was given a complimentary stay voucher even though the voucher expired a year later the hotel was understanding enough to still let us redeem it a year after expiry due to the fluid covid situation during our staycation we were given the club deluxe room and had absolutely nothing to complain about as it was clean and spacious we were also given club lounge access and received very hospitable service yummy fooddrinks from both shirley kenneth great hotel with great memories service remained top notch despite years of pandemic
164,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,average star hotel marketed at star whilst the hotel staff were pleasant enough and the foyer was fresh the rooms are in need of updating this is not to the standard of a star hotel the room was dark and a little dingy the carpet faded and obvious patches to the wallpaper that looked amateurish the airconditioner rattled mentioned but not actioned and the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor again mentioned with a fix applied that did not resolve the problem the pool is fantastic along with the gym breakfast is a crowded affair but with quite a range of food items at present there is a km walk to the nearest mrt station but one is being built across the road if the rooms were renovated i would return but i can just say i was disappointed with the deluxe room i booked
165,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,bad hospitality just checked in today we booked rooms and informed them a week in avance that we need rooms together and our check intime as we are travelling with our parents and kids now we have reached the hotel at pm and still our rooms are not ready and they are not on the same floor too more over we have booked the deluxe waterfront room but they have give us tennis court facing room nobody is there to help us also poor service
166,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,disappointed it wasnt the hotel i always frequented prepandemic overall qualitycleanliness staff kindness service level etc just seemed offi wonder if there was any change in management or something as it just seemed like it was a different hotel altogether
167,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,curb your enthusiasm generally this hotel is good however it is at best a star level us standard dont expect to get happy customer service and dont expect verbal explanations of hotel services and amenitiesyou will get a sheet of paper with qr codes the rooms are very basic but large large enough that they could add more and need to add more furniture restaurant is nice but service is very slow
168,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,amazing service kudos to shirley kenneth danny at the executive club lounge for always making us feel welcome and striking nice conversations they are friendly and attentive to our needs wide selection of cocktails with delicious appetisers and desserts certainly the highlight of our stay at the hotel
169,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,sg trip july i stayed for three days and i had a pleasant time the location is not as accessible to commercial areas but its easy to find your way around sg via grabcab dont forget to bring a universal power adapter for your electronic devices as the room is not equipped to support nonsg power plugs
170,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,club lounge i really like to thank the club lounge team shirley alex and kenneth serving me on jul they were very nice friendly especially alex who shared with us his knowledge we had a casual talk which feels like a friend the food and views here are really magnificent
171,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,our wonderful stay alex was professional and efficient in upgrading our room to ensure we had our executive club lounge not to be missed kenneth was responsible and responsive to our needs during the whole session in our lounge shirley did all the background arrangements that we are enjoying tonight its a place not to be missed it has nice skyline view watching prendp the food served are delicious and the best part are shirleyalexkenneth who made our day thank you
172,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,tremendous improvement required rooms were reasonably price location to mrt not convenient cleanliness of bathrooms poor hotel staff not friendly except verone at the check in counter was helpful staff at the restaurant not friendly except the foreign worker from busan cant remember the name too many people at breakfast makes it impossible to get at table especially when you are there for a business trip and need to rush for meetings

200,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,charged dollars for one way transfer from airport to hotel completely scam is this hotel avoid it at all cost over changed for dollars for one way transfer from airport to the hotel which was quoted dollars on the phone promised dollars refund but never happened yet the worst department of the hotel is concierge department liars and scammer
201,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,nice view out the room spacious rooms and walking distance to clarke quay we stayed in room and room has a very nice view overlooking singapore river room is spacious with complete amenities lobby area has artistic design and nice space and aesthetics for phototaking and to unwind for drinks staff are friendly but check in was a bit slow bathroom area is nice and looks newly renovated nicer than the room itself the only eyesore is the old tv with bad screen and sound probably need to replace that as it looks it is going to die out soon didnt go well with the nice decor of the whole hotel
202,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,hugely disappointing checked in today and hugely disappointed we were of course aware that this is not a star hotel and did not have high expectations to begin with but what we encountered was just appalling it is our standard practice to sanitize and do a wipedown whenever we check into any hotel even precovid other than the obvious table surfaces we were disgusted to find how dirty and dusty the other surfaces were refer to attached photo including the leather headboard of the bed shelves chairs handles etc and then there is the apparent lack of resources or simply a case of the hotel subbing out services to the cheapest service providers there was only one bath towel in the bathroom we paid for persons and we had to call housekeeping twice before someone came with
203,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,average staycation experience i like gym facility but pool is small breakfast is generally average about the same varieties on dn days customer service experience during check in restaurant for high tea and breakfast was pleasant and efficient however the carpet and furniture looks old tv screen size not big and all channels picture quality is poor and snowy

210,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,disappointing experience quite a number of areas to improve on perhaps too lengthy to mention here maybe this hotel is more for business stays i stayed with my family of and i didnt find it very family friendly especially for children
211,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,amazing staff we were concerned the room might be too small for kids but aris gracious hospitality made the staycation a truly memorable one a most enjoyable buffet dinner together with delightful walks alongside the singapore river as the family explored this part of singapore food capitols staff sally zangmo made our dining experience a joy with their friendly smiles surprise welcome drink for the kids it takes so little to delight the little ones there was a chess tournament in one of the convention rooms which engaged our family of avid chess players thoroughly enjoyed our nights here highly recommended
212,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,i would rather not book a hotel than live in grand copthorne book this hotel and you will experience what meanness rudeness unfriendliness and uncultured behaviour is from the checkin reception staff to the staff in the breakfast lobby everyone behaves as they operate some government department where one expects straightforward answers in india and in a tier travel city such as udaipur jaipur etc i would not pay even inr per day for the room that i was given in singapore for over inr per day the smallest i have stayed so far i have had my fair share of travel to europe dubai sri lanka and malaysia my wife has additionally traveled to hong kong and she too was thoroughly disappointed days our toiletries were not replaced linen was changed only once in days water bottles had to be brought sometimes from
213,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,canceling i cancelt the booking week ahead yet your hotel charged night this maybe stipulated in the booking but this was an emergency i had to go into surgery days before extremely poor service to charge me still i would have used the booking another day but seems your service only interested in charging

215,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,accommodation and club lounge our stay was for days nights initially our first room was very small for adults once we spoke to shirley the club manager she went above and beyond to keep us happy we got a bigger room amazing views of the city and very comfortable for our stay yes we did pay slightly more but it was well worth the extra dollars the club lounge staff we had the pleasure of meeting and looking after us were shirley jennifer kenneth megan and not forgetting the truly amazing danny this hotel should be so grateful for these truly amazing people their professionalism attention to detail and of course service were impeccable we were all made to feel so welcome comfortable and fussed over this was our daily experience after lots of walking and generally playing tourist we
216,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,wouldnt stay here again the place is very run down and struggled to give good service we were of us and gave us only towel per day coffee powder was never replaced after day one had to call multiple time to house keeping to it replenished kettle was stored in the cupboard had to be brought out every day to heat water for coffee or tea
217,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,disappointing stay i have stayed at millennium hotels for many years and at all tiers during my visits to singapore it seems that standards and service have declined and it was explained as being due to loss of staff during covid i do hope this will be remedied very soon
218,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,awesome experience awesome experience swimming pool was small my kids enjoyed the bathtub much more good service and pleasant staff breakfast food is not fascinating love the views and the mall is so near that you can just get over soon if you need some things
219,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,staff helpful amidst a large check in group staff were friendly and approachable having a staff who pressed the lift and gave instruction on what to do when going into the lift helped checking in can make one abit flustered
220,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,our new place to stay a great hotel with value for money and great location room was spacious and clean we had a great view bathroom was large and they only fault the room had was it needed usb connection in for tourist down stair lobby bar amazing go visit karlo service with a smile and mixes the best aperol spritz in town being so close to robison quay that had great restaurants and you have to shop at great world thanks for having us
221,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,food capital hotel restaurant housekeeping are appalling duty manager ismail is saving grace for the hotel in this star hotel which was named best luxury hotel not too long ago i am quite appalled that the major aspects of hospitality are lacking in this hotel housekeeping we were longterm guests in this hotel we stayed for nights on different levels with what we paid i believe we have become vip guests however on the st week we stayed in deluxe waterfront at th floor housekeeping was terrible in my experience never hire men from chinese mainland for housekeeping roles as they have no detail to attention or cleanliness and no aesthetic sense in keeping the room nice and clean when staying on th floor the beds were made like as if i was living in a prison it was not hotel standard and not perfectly clean the towel for feet we left on the toilet floor
222,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,website information does not tally with staffs info age of the room really shows desperately in need of maintenance not enough power points went to tempo for the high tea website shows pricing as for pax reached there staff does not want to honour it went to food capital intending to have dinner website shows discount for in house guests staff does not want to honour it as well claim its only
223,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,just a good location the hotel offers a good location at the singapore river walking distance to clarke quay with all its restaurants and bars the hotel urgently needs a complete renovation old brown colours wallpaper that is peeling off worn furniture the room service was not good sometimes towels were missing sometimes it was not cleaned correctly or drinks water were not provided there is no dusting in the room or in the restaurant the buffet is mediocre the hotels best times are behind it i will not stay there again
224,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,nice location dated interior the area around the hotel is really nice green and lots of great restaurants along the singapore river the hotel itself is disappointing in terms of maintenance and compares poorly to other fivestarhotels lobby restaurants elevators and rooms require renovation
225,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,awesome service with friendly and attentive staff we stayed here for my brothers birthday celebration and their service was great at the executive level warm hospitality and excellent services were executed by shirley the club manger and her team megan and kenneth they were very attentive to our needs would highly recommend to stay on the executive level
226,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,holiday stay at the grand copthorne waterfront singapore we stayed here for days club stay we had lovely room with beautiful views of the city room but unfortunately we were kept awake by the noise of the service elevator but after mentioning this to the staff they kindly moved us to an equally lovely room the club staff shirley jennifer kenneth and megan are very attentive kind and cheerful and very helpful with suggestions of where to visit i would thoroughly recommend this place to anyone coming to singapore
227,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,average stay for the price we paid the experience could have been better in terms of aesthetics and services hotel is somewhat dated in design and room maintenance could be better recommended to have staggered booking times for breakfast as it tends to get overcrowded in the restaurant at peak hours where it gets chaotic
228,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,great location located right on the river with a footbridge over to a great range of bars and restaurants even walked to chinatown from there great value with buffet breakfast included rooms a little small but clean friendly staff especially vincent the doorman who couldnt do enough for us good bar and cocktails my daughter and i were very happy
229,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,lovely time at the grand copthorne its an older style hotel with very good facilities and a really good location my husband and i stayed for nights in a club room on the th floor which in our opinion is well worth the addition spend the staff throughout the hotel are very accommodating but the staff at the executive lounge are especially so in particular shirley jennifer kenneth and megan could not do enough to ensure we had a great stay breakfast in served downstairs at the buffet restaurant which can be a little crowded at times however the food is always varied and of good quality the executive lounge is open from pm for soft drinks or teacoffee and from pm for cocktails and canapes there is a good selection of food available which is served to you in courses tapas style and also a
230,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,nice staff ok hotel we stayed at the grand copthorne for weeks the location is great right on the riverfront with easy access to restaurants and bars the staff were very friendly and professional the food was good overall the hotel and our room felt a bit tired and in need of an upgrade i would have thought that they could have taken advantage of the last years downtime to do some works but it seems that nothing was done if youre looking for a reasonable hotel in a good location the grand copthorne is a fair choice
231,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,as a member and longer stay price and location great did stay a bit longer high floor and with a view down to marina bay sands walking down the flod is perfect most staff very nice and did try their best the hair and spa in the hotel is absolutely great you dont need to go anywhere else both massage hair blow haircut and keratine treatment was great no rush and you are very well taken cared of easy to order foodpanda or whatever you want if you want in dining safe place and no smell of mold i would stay here again if i ever come back the pool and gym is a bit worn down but its ok breakfast is not for me since im scandinavian and very picky but it looked fairly fresh
232,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great hotel in an ideal location staff was wonderful and rooms were huge compared to other hotels i had stayed at in singapore hotel was clean and had a beautiful view could not ask for a better location location is central to lots of attractions in minutes we could walk to parks orchard rd and the merlion tons of great restaurants nearby concierge was so helpful with shipment we had coming to the hotel and with helping us schedule our return covid tests buffet breakfast was great too

237,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,pleasant enough building was a bit old compared to other star hotels so you cant expect swanky gleaming furnishing or everything working perfectly but overall comfortable and clean staff was pleasant and helpful near a big shopping mall

242,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,needs a lot of tlc the first room we were given was so filthy that they changed us to a new room after we strongly complained room cleaning was also poor due to the totally inadequate provision of cleaning staff we had to call the housekeeping manager to get the cleaner a vacuum for the carpet and a toilet brush to clean the toilet
243,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,glampin under the stars we booked room with glamping under the stars but not yet set up upon arrival still need to call and wait to set up my kids are excited to see the room but then theres nothing when we entered the room

245,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,star hotel star experience disappointed star hotel star experience booked and stayed in the club room with club access with late checkout at pm as per our tripcom booking but we were surprised to find that due to the pandemic late check out was subjected to availability and that the club access only operates from pm to pm with all day refreshment during the day from pm to pm there is all day nonalcoholic refreshments with cookies only tapas style meals are only available from to pm daily with menu changes daily there is no booking available for the club lounge first come first serve style remember to head there early to get a seat else you will be turned away from your entitlement breakfast the next day was held at the main lobby resturant which the staff was abit rude to guest waiting in
246,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,excellent services at the bar we enjoyed the excellent services from the friendly staff at the bar counter had an awesome birthday celebrations and enjoyed the good foods and drinks with my family members over the long weekend thanks for your excellent services provided
247,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,satisfactory experience the hotel room is dim bed is not firm and aircon is not functioning well middle of the night the room was warm and then cold again i think the thermostat is not functioning as it should location wise is not bad near to great world shopping mall and tiong bahru market the breakfast was mediocre
248,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,not a star hotel as it claims we had booked a waterfront deluxe room for nights but the ac in room was not working properly it was too cold after maintenance guy came it got too hot again we had to call them at midnight to change it back to as it was lighting in room is very dull need more lighting and bright lights in rooms please we had to switch on our flash lights at night if we needed to search something from bags waiting for the breakfast was unbelievable we had to wait for mins in line just to get a table at breakfast we had kids years and month old if we had been with any tour we would have had to miss the breakfast for sure food was good service was good but the property is not maintained as a star level category
249,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,horrible service horrible rude staff run down rooms the rooms are horrible we were group of families the staff was so rude no service at all no sense of hospitality rooms are so run down and so carpets are so smelly not recommended at all not worth the money they are charging we had booked all categories of room even suites were just horrible breakfast also very less options for vegetarians still staying in the room while giving this review
250,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,gcw front office are great other than that improvement needs to be done excellent front office staff halim and verona are great and cheerful also had a free upgrade with bathtub from halim thanks for offering the late checkout for my solo staycation cons bathtub looks moldy from the side and dusty water pressure good however the tissue box is broken and wall need painting and lights are not working well ordered room service mushroom soup and it arrived mins later on top of it it tasted bland and tasteless
251,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,liked our stay but didnt feel luxury or welcomed by some staff booked club deluxe room which comes with club benefits overall we liked our stay mainly for view and club but didnt feel luxury or welcomed by some staff which is the main reason i probably would not return positivethe room is quite big and the view is really pretty ensure to request for rivermarina view room is clean and comfortable the pool and jacuzzi temperature was nice to use buffet breakfast was served at the lobby and was delicious but not wide variety or luxury items club lounge was relaxing food quality was good but limited variety and again not luxury item the lounge staff shirley and jennifer were always attentive especially shirley goes beyond with drink recommendations and helped to extend our checkout ensure to try her recommendations
252,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,magically appearing room upon checking in at the appointed pm we were told that the room was available only at pm after protestation a room magically appears from the unsmiling staff if you like neat tricks this is your hotel otherwise the stay was uneventful
253,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,zero customer satisfaction we stayed at grand copthrone waterfront for nights in the deluxe waterfront room the view from room was amazing overlooking the river and partial view of marina bay sands the disappointing things were front desk staff not at all friendly and never ever even tried to understand our request it was my sons birthday so when we checked in at that time too i had informed the hotel about the same later just one day before too i approached the front desk and requested them to arrange some ballons and a cake for celebrating his birthday important thing is i told them to charge for all this not do it for free still nothing was done when we returned to the hotel i literally had to fight to get a small pastry from them as they kept on refusing by giving excuses of closing
254,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,birthday celeb the service is fantastic shirley and jennifer were awesome in making our lounge stay memorable food are great and drinks are perfect thank you for the best customer service thank you from mark sheryl
255,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,big name poor service not for business traveller only for groups great location but very poor service attitude small rooms no restaurant capacity in coffee shop hence missed breakfast had to ask for housekeeping service lobby bar is poor this hotel is for groups not for business travellers
256,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,singapore grand copthorne water front from the time we walked in the door we where welcomed the staff helped use with every question about the places we booked to see and gave advice on the best times and other attraction we might like to see the hotel is in walking to place china town and a lot of food eateries in the area out back is the river which has a good walking link to parts of the main city and is very clean
257,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,excellent service we stayed for days nights firstly i commend the fast check in we had it took only a few minutes for us to get in our room is just ok for us too its huge actually secondly the executive lounge service is perfect they dont let our table be emptied of food and drinks which we liked lol megan let us try the blended drinks shirley ginger and sea breeze for our final night shes very accommodating they all are thirdly the breakfast buffet is awesome the pool is great theyd consider those who are ft below in height lol i just found the toilet kinda weird cos no bidet but overall i paid so worth it for this staycation dude

260,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,our getaway in general we had a good staycation it was worth paying for club floor privileges service there was good we truly appreciated the warm and personable service provided by shirley club manager and danny club executive who were both very attentive consistently diligent and efficient while maintaining a very calm and assuring disposition with business picking up space maybe a constraint and it may become a challenge to service a larger group of guests the food capital cafe could not cater to the large breakfast crowd so there maybe a need for either having different seatings or to provide more seating perhaps in another room like some hotels which open up other function rooms there is a need for the services of porters
261,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,terrible staycation check in was quite ok managed to get a room at pm for the suite room room spacious although not clean sofa also got smell please do not ever book the club room as the food is really terrible tiny plates of cold dish tiny plates of hot dish non refillable all the dishes are like nugget sized btw ask for refill and was told that food non refillable and can only offer to us if have excess haha first time come across so terrible lounge access but luckily drinks refillable although very limited overall experience feels like eating mcdonalds piece nuggets very unique special experience wont be able to find elsewhere for sure people were refused at the door saying full house but they will try their best to accommodate but no promise if cannot make it in
262,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great service by shirley had a birthday staycay here shirley wished me a happy birthday the moment i step foot there thoughtful service and staff was very attentive to our needs and also explained to us the dishes that were being served great experience
263,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,no longer star standard overall room was dated but decent only gripe was with the drilling that went on in the next room the whole afternoon they could have assigned us a room away from the drilling im sure they werent at max capacity breakfast spread was also too small stations at a star hotel left much to be desired
264,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,awesome stay we arrived at am and were welcomed with great service which continued throughout our stay the hotel is very clean with very friendly staff our room was very comfortable and room service was also excellent

270,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,commendation on jennifer first i would like to commend jennifer jennifer from the club lounge was exceptional in her service from the first day of checking into the hotel she remembers my wife and me and attended to our needs promptly she introduced every dish that was served during the course and constantly checked in with us if we are doing fine and if we needed more drinks definitely will return in the future if it permits well done grand copthorne waterfront hotel singapore

273,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,spacious but old room terrible service i stayed here nights with my family this old hotel has a renovated newish look in the lobby but the room itself is still very old service here was rude the entire breakfast service was under staffed and guests were being shouted at instead of being served room wasnt properly cleaned possibly the worst stay in singapore
274,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,birthday celebration room was spacious and good for friends stay since we were three and had our own beds the room ac was quite weak and could not keep the room cool in the afternoon and staffs responsiveness to requests was quite poor

276,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,bad bad bad experience pathetic unfriendly and rude behaviour of staff no efforts made bu anyone to make sure customer is satisfied in any front possible the overall objective of the staff to make sure either they make more money or just do the no of hours to complete there shift and go home to state an experience on my fourth day it took me mins and asking different people for a water bottle near the breakfast area as i had to take some medicine but they were all just not bothered about me at all i will make sure that everyone i know never ever visit your hotel and have such a bad experience
277,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,grand copthorne stay initially got upgraded to executive floor suite old but large room and executive floor snacks and drinks were great between pm breakfast too busy and not an awful lot of choice so went once and didnt bother again overall nice hotel in good location but work needs to be done on breakfast
278,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,night stay in singapore to visit relatives value for money stay at a riverfront hotel in singapore the best part is the location next to the riverside walkway which leads all the way to marina bay we did the walk early every morning to see the sunrise at marina bay
279,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,seamless stay went for a dayca check in and out procedures were very smooth we arrived earlier and hotel let us check in earlier great that they were not too particular about the check in timing walked by the gym and spent some time at the pool all was good
280,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,executive lounge shirley is very attentive and proactive in assessing our needs which is greatly appreciated and a nice departure from the front desk on the ground floor she gave us a hours extension to the check out further to the hour extension given by front desk which is greatly appreciated danny is also extremely efficient and generous with his attention and wine pouring and both were good with keeping the hor doeuvre for us beyond the pm limit brilliant service

284,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,not a super good experince sleeping quality was horrible due to huge service elevator noise i stayed at that i recemmed to cancel this room at all bar service is not good i cannot order anything at late night executive lounge on th floor view is amazing however served free drinks was cheast brand which are not tasty at all
285,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,grand hotel really lovely hotel with a grand lobby the pool was really enjoyable with deck chairs which was a nice way to cool off after being out all day in the the heat of the city for singapore standards the room was very spacious and the bathroom was so impressive with a lovely powerful shower and a large bath the rooms have big floor to ceiling windows providing a great view to the city the location was excellent you can easily walk from the hotel to clarke quay by simply following the river the breakfast was a little disappointing with limited options although this may be because of covid just across the river there is a great choice of restaurants and bars the concierge were so helpful we had a late flight back and they allowed us to store our luggage all day and use the
286,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,basically best service checkin is hassle free the room is clean services are notably top notch foods in the club lounges and food capital are delicious requested a river view and the view is fantastic especially at night definitely will come again for my next staycation
287,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great family staycay booked executive rooms for our family of over the good friday period rooms kudos to danny shirley for making us felt at home with excellent service and serving us with varieties of alcoholicnonalcoholic cocktails and juices also made it a point to explain the food served cold dish hot dish and dessert pity that the club lounge is only open from the afternoon as the breakfast at level one was heavily packed and the staff there were simply overwhelmed with exhausted and disgruntled expression hence we only had bfast there once the following day we had ours at great world city instead which is just a min walk from the hotel we also managed to catch a movie the secrets of dumbledore there as well gym was very wellequipped but swimming pool
288,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,wonderful stay at the executive lounge we highly recommend the visit of the executive lounge shirley the club manager and jennifer the club executive had been very courteous and helpful it nearly was like being at home thank you so much nice fingerfood and cocktails for happy hour

290,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,highly recommended club lounge husband and i stayed in the club room great room excellent service in the club lounge ms jennifer and ms chng manager have great people skills made us feel very welcomed knowledgeable about sightseeing around the hotel and excellent customer service will definitely return the only downside is that we would have liked it if our breakfast was at the loungebut hopefully things will relax in the future
291,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,holiday jennifar has provided us with such loyalty when in the lounge as we were supported and provided with various option including desserts we were grateful to have such a kind community around us thanks jennifar and shirley kind regards from patel family
292,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,good experience hotel staff were friendly liya the phone operator from the rooms reservationhotels main line attended to my request very professionally and fulfilled my special request breakfast was ok but more different options should have been added in the menu overall satisfied with my stay
293,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,very good the staff was amazing very helpful and friendly the location is great by the river with restaurants and cafés close by it was very easy to catch a taxi and in less then minutes we were at the shopping malls
294,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,good location but once off stay came early and decided to lunch at the restaurant at the lobby waited minutes for our meals even though there was not a lot of guests at that point in time one staff mentioned it was because it was ala carte another mentioned it was because of the chef and the third mentioned it was because there was a lot of orders to handle was quite unhappy with the discrepancies but at least they tried to remedy it by providing complimentary dessert got to checked in but when we finally went up workers were at the room we were assigned to fixing a hinge at the door we had to stand outside the room after we expected to check in and rest and ask them to call front office to ask them for a change of room not to dispute the efficiency of the staff in the change of rooms but if the
295,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,home away from home reading some of the other reviews we were initially a bit concerned about what our experience will be like here but i can safely say this was one of the best stays at any place across the world first part of our stay was in the executive suite which is very spacious comes with services like free laundry pc day and executive lounge privileges alex megan lynn ensured we felt comfortable looked after and attended to in the lounge as we took most of our work calls there during the day ms shirley loved the drink they have named after her is a kind fabulous lady who ensures things run smoothly for all present on the floor our second part of the stay was in the serviced residences of the hotel we changed our plans from staying elsewhere after we saw the
296,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,not quite star staff all excellent but quality of the hotel not great room spacious but basic and furniture damaged worn needed painting very clean though food area more like a canteen than bar reminded me of airport bar not very welcoming and small room service very limited in choice of food and liguid eggs used for breakfast executive lounge very nice and work it for the drinks food served free of charge for hrs in the evening great views from the th lounge floor
297,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,an excellent stay this was our first stay at grand copthorne but definitely it wont be our last we booked the executive suite riverview it was extremely well designed and comfortable the staff was responsive and courteous the property is beautiful and happy hour on the th floor was fun extra added value for me since i am a biologist the otters swam down the river every morning the grand copthorne will be our new home whenever we are in singapore
298,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,a nice welcome back to singapore after years of isolation being a club member provided additional privileges particularly the cocktail hour with hors doeuvres from to week evening jennifer our host at the club lounge did a wonderful job with fantastic hospitality with a welcoming and delightful personality serving beverages of your choice accompanied by well thought out three course hors doeuvres which were tasty and innovative from checking in to the highly accommodating concierge service was delightful and wonderful in getting back to full service for a major hotel in singapore i look forward to coming back to singapore as soon as convenient a delightful experience made more pleasurable by the evening at the club lounge with jennifer

301,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,stay in connecting rooms deluxe and single room and i felt that being a star hotel i did not get the wow factor of being in a star hotel for a start the connecting rooms were not opened despite earlier request during reservations for connecting roomthought this was intuitive as i never encountered this issue with other hotels there were quite a few faulty items in either rooms thermostat not working spoilt bathroom fixtures overall bed quality and standard of housekeeping were good the staff also were very hospitable polite and efficient would recommend this hotel if you were looking for only to have a place to sleep but not indulge
302,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,jacuzzi not working and dont come here if your vegetarian asked twice for the jacuzzi to be fixed in nights this didnt happen same tongues being used for meat and vegetarian products spoke to reception who quite correctly the next day more tongues were visible however one member of staff didnt speak english so you got all of the flavours ehhh one frying pan for your omelette which also contained meat
303,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,enjoyable stay with convenient location really enjoyed our stay here the staff redzuan vincent paul and steven were highlights to the stay here it is very nicely located along the river with wonderful places to eat i would recommend a river side room as the view is wonderful

309,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,the hotel cannot be rated as stars longer check in and check out process due to staff cannot find the bookings information furniture in room were old and dusty it was not well maintain expecially during the covid situation cannot feel the friendiness of the staff simply special request were being ignore
310,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,wedding banquet we booked years in advanced and due to covid had to keep postponing and was passed from one banquet manager to another but nonetheless serene was excellent in assisting us with all the planning and changes especially with such uncertain times only down sight was that due to the restrictions alot of what we got from the package got removed and we werent given an option to cancel with a full refund but besides that serene really made the experience so much more pleasant through it all
311,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,days nights staycation at grand corpthorne waterfront hotel had a very enjoyable time at this hotel booked a club room for a family stay there during the school holiday room was at the th floor it was excellent with a great view of singapores skyline service was excellent especially at the executive club club manager shirley and her colleague jennifer were warm and friendly and they were very professional in their services we throughly enjoyed our time during our stay there

313,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,did not meet star hotel standard thank you very much for the complimentary cake however i believe you can only feel that this is a star hotel if you book a club room for access on executive lounge for dining very few options for a star hotel we were actually surprised because star hotels even provide more food choices than this for lunch buffet theres no pasta and seafood is limited theres no more refill for nd round for breakfast theres no pancake waffle or rice very disappointed about this
314,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,significantly deteriorated post covid my experience was well below the standards i have grown to expect some areas were understaffed and staff were poorly trained breakfast service was quite poor the hotel even ran out of butter one morning perhaps covid is the excuse but if things dont improve by my next visit i may have to change hotels
315,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,worst service rude management worst experience didnt expect this from grand copthorne the sales director danny doesnt even know how to talk to customers surprised to see why the management is having such a ride person at this level seriously do not consider this there are much better options nearby

317,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,good location but hotel feels old hotel probably used to be good but now it is dated and old the decor and rooms need to be refurbished although that will probably mean the currently attractive room rates will go up on the plus side the location is great and the club lounge is nice
318,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,speed of check in hotel need to be improve check in hotel waiting time too long hopefully can improve better room is pretty small checking hour is too late at pm wasted in the waiting period to check in good location near to great world city shopping mall

324,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,rooms are very tired and need updating rooms were very tired with limited plugs to charge laptops or mobile phones tv was ancient and generally the room was very much in need of modernizing i would say the hotel is more in line with a rather than a as they advertise

328,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,good for a night rest recommended for business travelers looking for a nights rest we booked deluxe room for our minihoneymoon after our wedding to our surprise we were upgraded to a deluxe club room however was told we are not entitled for club lounge facility was told it was chargeable head back to the room and made ourselves a coffee and tea hotel was kind enough to sent us a piece of cake overall was an average stay however dining at the food capital buffet could better all i can say is we had better dining experience for hotels with the same star rating breakfast was average too chefs servers serving us was average too the price is okay for a star hotel but sad couldnt experience true star service and dining will recommend for family look for a pool to play and business
329,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,a pleasant weekend stay in the month of feburary we had a pleasant weekend stay in the month of feburary check in was efficient and we were offered a complimentary late checkout granted the hotel rooms and facilities were a wee bit dated and the food selection at breakfast was somewhat limited but these are things that can be worked on we enjoyed the club lounge service where we were offered sincerity of the staff at the club lounge inclduing with javin and shirley there was another gentleman and lady whose names we forgot at the lounge sincere apologies javin thank you for your insights on the working in the service industry and sorry for making you stay past pm i lost track of time wishing everyone the very best

331,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,pleasant yet disappointed ambience like the environment of the hotel and there is just a park that is suitable for morning jog good scenes for a morning jog if you are looking for some fresh air outdoor food could have added more variety for breakfast service inconsistencies in the service provided by staff at the lounge friendliness of staff varies between guests checking in slow and long as staff seems unfamiliar of the checking in procedures he has to get help from his colleague who was attending to other guests this prolonged the check in process suggestions the exclusive service provided at club lounge for guests staying at executive suite should be available for the day rather than from pm i wanted to seek assistance for checkin and when encountering problem with my room card
332,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,not star level quality rooms my room was old outdated and dirty in places i do expect better for a hotel in this price range aircon vents had mould carpets were fraying dirt in corners of bathroom scuff marks on walls paint coming off walls food in my opinion was good and the hotel staff are amazing very friendly and helpful having said all this i did extend my stay here due to poor laziness on my part having to find another hotel and relocate

368,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,only worth staying if you receive a good deal rate wanted to give a pretty honest and thorough review of the hotel so those international guests staying for longer periods of times not staycations know what to expect i stayed here for days right after they opened back up to the general public th december first of all the staff were extremely helpful in helping with the required documentation for international travel in my case vtl including following up and helping me with my vtl application as the hotel was not listed as an option of where you can stay they also were able to print all my paperwork required to return home such as my entry declaration and negative covid results and delivered it to my room within minutes of my asking for it so huge positives there check in for me was pretty much instant as my
369,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,awesome visit to be honest this hotel has seen some time and the room looks a bit old but i think they didnsome refurbishing of the hotel lobby and upgrading the pool area as well though the pool can still be used stayed in the executive club room and had access to the lounge the lounge was on level and had an awesome view of the city they have cocktail hour too which serves an awesome set meal breakfast can be served in the lounge too though limited choices the room i was allocated to is quite dark not sure if it applies to other rooms too but quite pleasant comes with a bathtub and seperate shower area while boiling water the glass table top of the coffee table cracked i reported this to the hotel and after some discussion they were happy to take this accident off the

372,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,enjoyable stay with great service overall we had a good stay in grand copthorne their service was top notch in order to appease to guests during this pandemic i felt the staff handled things really well to reduce unavoidable inconveniences to their guests like the checking in procedure the preregistration link didnt work for me so when we reached we were told there would be a mins wait but as part of their service recovery they provided seatings and coffeetea and snacks and called us when it was our turn to check in because of that the wait didnt feel long at all so kudos to them for providing this extra service but do note that as of dec the lift serving the carpark to the hotel lobby wasnt working and there were no redirection signs together with other groups we found ourselves
373,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,comfortable experience the hotel was old but the service was great and professional staffs were very patient despite many requests were being made by other guests room was comfortable and bed was big although the hotel is old it was still really clean and the housekeeping service was great do be patient with the staffs there as they are trying their best to meet everyones requirements dont be like this other man whom we saw screaming at the concierge

377,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,serious deficiency in housekeeping staff explained that management decided to accept large volume of festive bookings though the number of housekeeping staff is insufficient this led to long waits of as much as hours to receive room keys upon arrival and poor room cleaning during the stay
378,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,a retreat for the long christmas weekend stayed here over the christmas weekend despite being a long weekendit was not crowded when i came for checkin it was pretty much a breeze even tho i did not get to book a slot for checkin online booked direct from website as im a millenium hotel memver and the rates were pretty good room abit dated but very spacious got the river view and its prettt calming aft sunset service is excellent but i wish they had at least provided some halal options when it comes to dining if they had halal foodit would be perfect will definitely consider coming back
379,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,executive suite review booked night stay at executive suite for staycation hotel service was great but the suite was very dated it looks the same as my last stay more than years ago tv reception was quite weak with grainy pictures i think its time for hotel to refurbish their rooms
380,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,horrible experience waited for hours to be checked in arrived at pm at the hotel as that was the stated check in time but was told time after time that they were still cleaning the rooms ended up waiting hr in the hotel lobby for the room we preordered food to be delivered to us at pm but by the time we checked in and could start eating it was already pm and our food was so cold we tried using the room phone to call front desk but no one pick up we personally went downstairs to ask if they could help to heat up the food and they refused so the summary of our stay was hrs spent in hotel lobby had a very late and cold dinner when we finally could check in and staff refused to lend help in heating up our food despite making us spend our staycation in their hotel lobby cant believe we took leave and spent money on
381,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,bad sevices not a good hotel to stay check i took so long concierge guy just open our room door and come in room was not clean during the make up did not vacuum and clear trash no topping up of water coffee tea and sugar

384,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,excellent service serivce was very good employee were very patient never for once they lost their cool even though the hotel is quite busy at all times they know the room types rates etc very well good lcoation and reasonable price
385,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,family staycation apparently this hotel just reopened sometime mid dec thumb up booked for a club deluxe room and superior double room for a night and a front deck korean accent lady was very kind to upgrade the superior double to a club floor level because we are checking in as a family nice had a great time at the exec lounge asst manager nishel was very hospitable and goes the extra mile to even prepare some nice cocktails her great personality certainly made up for the lack of varieties of food and space thumbs down rooms are covered with dust even though it went thru some sgclean regiment club deluxes fan coil might required a service as its noisy
386,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,poor service and quality the room and furnishings are old and dingy customer service is poor taking more than an hour for simple requests and multiple calls to staff the equipment in the room is of poor quality television is more than a decade old iron is of poor quality and ruined my clothes cleaning or service did not improve throughout my week stay i understand the peak season however the onus should be on the hotel to employ more staff and ensure quality is kept up this was the most expensive and most unpleasant stay i have had at a hotel
387,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great service great experience assisted by mr shab from the concierge he was very accommodating and patient and he was able to address all our questions and needs but we were not able to get our complimentary drinks from tempo and were not able to use the pool anyway overall experience was excellent will surely recommend to our friends

389,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,far from superior tired dated dark drab and not star worthy this was not a good choice or value for money the staff were excellent and they work very hard but seems there isnt enough of them or enough desks at reception expect long queues breakfast was soso and there are much better options for morning food along the river
390,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,gcw a great hotel by the river room was great at club floor level served by ms lynn who was very attentive and helpful we had a great fb team like never before ie mr gavin mr bryan mr danny ms megan etc the fb team was a mark higher and starkly better than previous club experiences a slight note is that the water pressure in the shower was not great that said it wasnt a huge issue the previous night and a few other nights prior to the stay i had great buffet dinners with mr steven wu and previously with mr dennis both of whom are great persons from food capital the breakfast spread this time was way better than before and i especially think that the new club breakfast experience is better as well with twg offerings amongst many others the club team placed extra efforts to
391,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,lovely hotel we stayed at the grand copthorne watefront for days the room was big and the marina bay view was awesome the breakfast have so many varieties the hotel staff was the asset of the hotel reception desk and paul concierge was very accommodating and helpful highly recommend hotel for staycation
392,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,the worst star hotel in singapore should be downgraded this is the worst staycation i ever had and for this hotel to be star is an absolute joke they should be downgraded immediately until they finally refurbish and improve their service standards other hotels have fared way better facing the same issues brought by this pandemic so theres no excuse for this hotel to fail so terribly like this the hotel ignored my simple room request highfloor river view without providing a valid explanation or even a reasonable solution not only that the checkin staff even fluffed me by saying my room th floor is already high context the hotel has guestrooms from th floor he even tried to make it sound i should thank him for being so lucky i could even check in at pm considering the hotel was supposedly
393,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,worst ever to be avoided at all cost absolutely dreadful experience and the worst ever service level check in took minutes the restaurant refused us entry despite arriving minutes prior to published closing time we were told that inroom dining was unavailable however after complaining to the duty manager it became miraculously available it took many calls to place an order for fish and chips what arrived was reheated dry and inedible the next day despite several reminders the room was not cleaned no fresh towels toiletries or drinking water were provided we order in room dining early when nothing was delivered we called again only to be told that the kitchen was not responding and that they will chase them they never called back we called again we were told that the items we ordered steak and
394,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great family staycation our nights stay was a smooth sailing one with fast checkin and efficient service the lobby was never crowded as they strictly adhere to safe distancing measures which make us feel at ease room was spacious with city view and what makes our experience a memorable one is the fact that ms june lee the reservations and communications manager was attentive to our needs as a family she was very accommodating and advised us the necessary things to keep in mind especially during this new norm booking of the pool time slot was also a breeze though it is a pretty small m pool yet it is cosy enough for some pool fun and they have a jacuzzi too the breakfast buffet spread was a variety but do note that although they dont serve pork or lard it is not halal certified
395,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,2,gcwh staycay check in had a delay of hours and some of the staff were very unhelpful and unfriendly we were asked to request for late check out due to the delay but when requestes they only gave us an extra half an hour overall the location and rooms were good but the checkin experience was really uncalles for
396,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,an overall ok staycation checkin took hours believe due to housekeeping otherwise staff service were good received free breakfast and lounge drinks as a result of the delay in checkin we had an overall ok and enjoyable staycation still
397,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,4,staycation checkin process took a while somewhat expected given the covid safety measures hopefully this aspect will ease up in due course with more manpower or it help the room decor appeared dated but the club room was quite ok in maintenance the friendliness professionalism customeroriented attitude and services of the staff are commendable from frontdesk ted housekeeping chinese lady serving l club lounge nishel shirley and food capital we felt welcomed and at home the food capital staff a chinese gentleman on duty around pm plus on dec was fast in service recovery and delivered as promised despite a glitch in the food order service we appreciated his help to expedite our dinner despite the crowd and challenges covid safety measures manpower
398,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,terrible check in expetience check in time was from pm onwards reached the hotel around pm and thought that we could get our room however the lobby was full of people waiting we joined the long queue to know that we need to wait for another hr in order to join the main queue for check in not only that i was greeted by a male staff in a very nonchalant attitude i commented that check in was stated pm why do we have to wait further he commented that check in time was from pm to pm nonetheless he directed us to the waiting area and served us some snacks he mentioned that he would give me a call waited for almost hrs no call from the staff we decided to look for him and end up he mentioned that we could join the queue this was really terrible if we didnt take the initiative to
399,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great staff great room breakfast could be better check in fairly smooth even thought it is peak season although understaffed i believe everyone on the team went the extra mile to provide me and my partner a great experience huge thanks to shirley chng from the executive club lounge who really made this a rating
400,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,3,stay experience not valued for money checks in was really bad waited for more than hrs no basic beverage was offered to cope with the situation drinks was only offered upon asking room cleanliness standard was poor as television wasnt switched off not sure if the room was cleaned in a hasty manner or wasnt clean at all
401,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,bad experience overall firstly the checkin process was horrible waited for hours to check in when ask the front desk why the checkin process was that long nobody can give an explanation there is no comfortable place for us to wait for the checkin we had to stand in queue for hours which was tiring we talk to some manager name andy but he was unable to answer our question and kept apologizing to us for the service standard which is something i do not understand if the manager do not know what he was doing how the other staff know what to do without proper instruction and plans to follow front desk offered us a free coupon for dinner at their fb outlet but when we reach there the fb hostess did not have a seat to assign us and we had to wait for mins for them to sort out their
402,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,excellent staycation it was a excellent stay we went on dec we went there for anniversary and it was bliss the queue for checking in was bit long it could be improved nonetheless the staff was apologetic and offered us cake and fruit basket it was indeed great service ms lin was so kind the toiletries were generous the cleaning was good the air con was adjustable the swimming book slot was also easy and not much crowded the breakfast buffet was provided jus a kind request to make it halal so we can enjoy more varieties we did eat the pastries tea and cereal and it was delicious thanks for making our anniversary memorable we appreciate it grand copthorne
403,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,hour wait times for checkin the long wait times to checkin hours in total is not acceptable i arrived at pm waited in line till pm for checkin only to be told that my room was not ready i only got the keys to my room at pm for a night stay it might be helpful to review the manual checkin process and ensure that rooms are prepared before the guests arrive as part of the usual sop of a star hotel while the staff are friendly and this is appreciated there is no other form of compensation or refund offered to all the guests who waited hours for their rooms the value of this stay is definitely not what me and the other guests paid for
404,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,days night staycation it was a last minute staycay arrangement for myself and i choose grand copthorne waterfront for my short getaway from busy lifemy main objective is just want to release my stress from work and definitely it is such a great hotel to choose for booking has been made days before my check in date and it is via bookingcom platform and i was unable to do via official website reservation due of no room are available but it is totally grateful to me because i still have a great deal in bookingcom for my preference room that i wanted anyway as per below here i will share my experience with this wonderful property th dec i reached to the hotel around hrs and proceed to do my pre registration as per hotel email that has been sent to memy slot time for pre

406,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,5,great the waiting time when arrive was slightly long due to the long que but overall was ok room is big and the view is fantastic but the unable to book the timing for pool due to the huge amount of guests staying there
407,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,poor management at the hotel bad hotel waited hrs to know room not available offered high tea to wait but in the end only gave coffee and bread with canned tuna when got into room tv and power plug not working looks like star hotel to me if you read this review take it as a warning never to come to this hotel ever edit no housekeeping was provided went there dn went out second day at pm and put room on housekeeping mode cameback at pm pm pm pm still no housekeeping called their receptionist dialed they said they send someone waited until i checked out still no housekeepingi you have better odds of striking toto than them having their housekeeping service coming cancel your bookings if you can
408,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,overbooked and overpromised hotel stated that checkin was at pm arrived at pm and there was a long queue and a staff told me that id have to wait hours to checkin around pm received phone call to return for checkin at pm went down and there were still no rooms available and was directed to the waiting area for refreshments room was supposedly available around pm but no staff could confirm the existence of said room in the end asked for a refund as it made no sense to stay further staff was nonchalant and nonapologetic about the entire fiasco went to agoda and apparently it states that i have checkedin supremely upset by the lousy service and poor planning
409,Grand Copthorne Waterfront Singapore,1,worst check in experience ever called to ask if can check in earlier were told to pay extra charges end up made to wait for more than hours to check in at usual timing so check in early need to pay but check in late due to hotel management no refund

411,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,good clean hotel zero facilities and service as soon as you arrive after a long tiring flight with kids no bell boys or luggage service you have to drag all your luggage to your room yourself at least they provided some trollies not fun when you have rooms booked for people and around pieces of luggage check in took some time as well bare minimum room service cant give any food or plates or cutleries after pm no concierge to help you with anything daily house keeping ok hotel entrance steps are so dirty havent been cleaned for the duration of my stay rooms are actually quite ok but when you pay almost dollars a night you expect a bit more dont think ill ever come back here
412,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,clean and great location we stayed here for the f weekend and it was perfect for our needs considering all hotels in sin were very expensive over this time the room was clean shower is great air conditioning worked perfectly and the beds super comfy if i had to mention one thing it would be the limited basically none english speaking tv channels wifi worked well and front reception were very nice and friendly happily stay again
413,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,a lovely location ruined by the experience the hotel is located on scotts road which is about a minute walk from orchard road the main shopping district as a location its almost perfect the staff however is unhelpful and unaccomodating the experience from check in is horrible they are slow with giving you the room and will not accommodate a late checkout request the food is good rooms are large and clean however the front desk staff is not at all helpful and does not live up to the standards you would expect in a star hotel there was no hospitality here
414,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,do not stay at this hotel i will be writing a separate review when i have time however i am extremely frustrated and angry at this hotel i booked and paid for this hotel two weeks in advance i notified the booking agency and emailed the hotel in advance i would be arriving late and when i arrive despite all information showing that i had to confirm and paid for booking they inform me that there was no room available basically they sold my room to someone else charged me a no show despite early communications then the front desk lady kicked me out of the hotel during one of the busiest weeks of the year in singapore separately will review again in detail i will be reporting this to the authorities here in singapore
415,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,lost its soul and direction i have previously reviewed this hotel and gave it very high ratings it had a great location warm friendly and helpful staff and was good value overall all that has now gone except for the location my wife and i recently spent a week in this hotel in a premier king double paying over usd night and whilst the hotel bills itself as star and charged star prices the services are not star more like star specifically the hotel has no concierge or porter servive we arraived at am after a delayed flight and had to get all our own luggage out of the airport taxi and to checkin and then our room by ourselves the telephone response time from operator and housekeeping is really bad we often had to call up to times and over minutes to get any answer there are no international pay tv channels on their tv system other than the free channels such as france dw etc but no cnn bbc cnbc bloomberg etcand no movie channels or options most cahannels are malaysian and indonesian and not in english name me another start hotel anywhere with such poorofferings the rooms only get cleaned every two days and when we enquired why we were told it was a ecofriendly approach nice very convenient excuse but frankly wehn i stay in a star hotel i expect my bed to be made up every day thanks the hotel is cold literally we switched off the ac in our room on arrival and it was still cold one week later when we checked out the room is on a rfid system and as soon as you leave the room and remove your key card the system reverts to dafault and the ac operates agin the old warmth and charm of the staff is now entirely absent in summary this hotel is charging start prices for inferior service they seem to be marketing to mostly local asian guests from malaysia and indonesia with a heavy muslim influence seen in many different ways including halal buffets breakfast lunch and dinner theres no problem with that as such just that the feeling of the property is no longer star either the hotel management do not seem to understand what they trying to be and for whom the overall impression is one of a hotel that is squeezing its margins to the maximum without concern for service standards perhaps asian gussts dont care or complain overall we now rate this hotel very poorly and we will never stay there again especially as there are many other choices in the same general location at similar prices providing better guest services this is not a matter of cost but value for money and the general experience of the property and the stay
416,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,hated my experience for the last years royal plaza has always been my first choice the halal kitchen selections at breakfast clean room and the welcoming doorman and porters are the reasons to why i kept coming back i recently stayed here from aug till sept i can honestly say itll be my last when i arrived i was surprised the uncle who always welcomes us was not there there were no porters to help us with the luggages even it didnt feel like going to a hotel at all over the years i do notice the choices at breakfast is shrinking noodle soups many choices for congee condiments salad dressing pastries and bread are the name a few that is no more it felt like going to a breakfast buffet as for room cleanliness i was quite upset that only when i arrived that the room is going to be clean every other day it was a hassle having to notify room service every day if i knew i would have gone to grand hyatt which is just across the road thank you for the last years ill be going to a different hotel for my next singapore trip
417,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,was a better hotel before covid i explicitly booked this hotel because i enjoyed breakfast in the past which is very important for me for a good start in the day what a disappointment this time quality of breakfast has extremely deteriorated details later furthermore the wifi was not stable and there was no movie channel on tv only international news channels or some asian soap operas rooms are ok but these other small things make you enjoy the stay since at checkout nobody was interested in a feedback nor what other hotels do an email with a feedback request was sent here for the hotel management some details on the breakfast i hope theyll read it summarized offer more fresh products and improve variety for example no noodle soup anymore no saltpepper at the tables eg for the omelette juices only in small plastik containers i prefer to drink out of a glas only english breakfast tea no green tea fruit tea or earl grey tea being offered for the omelette no fresh mushrooms only canned mushrooms and no tomatoes at all being offered the dish mixed vegetables was made with canned mushrooms beans the dal was more a soup ie not enough lentils dragon fruit melon and grapes were fresh but pears and peaches only canned very limited choice of cereals only have half what is on the list says on rotation but why not offering all
418,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,part time service room looks recently updated and is in good condition it is not as large as on our previous stay here tv service is shockingly bad with one english news channel cna which i catch up with at home the remainder is a few foreign language stations tea and coffee consists of satchels of coffee two teabags and two coffee mate satchels an electric jug rooms services every days whether needed or not who does thhs no concierge to arrange taxis
419,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,not really impressed seen better despite the fact its a hotel i did not get the five star feel from it from the moment we arrived there was no bell hop and we had to take our own luggage up after check in the breakfast was average to say the least more like a or at best we stayed for nights and housekeeping only cleaned our room once on the plus side the staff are friendly overall not impressed not worth the money might as well get a and save yourself some money
420,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,excellent location not too exciting property very conveniently located hotel with very big rooms this is on orchard road with everything within walking distance breakfast was very mediocre with most of the dishes empty by am for covid reasons they do not clean rooms during the stay but offer extra amenities if requested service was good but didnt have a very welcoming feeling about the reception area for location i may stay again but prefer if my room can be cleaned during the stay as its what makes hotel visits more exciting
421,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent stay we spent nights at the royal plaza and it was immaculate as always we were upgraded to the premier room staff were friendly as ever and the free breakfast is much appreciated although they could have changed the menu up a little bit understandably service has slightly dropped due to the pandemic we were told that our room would only be cleaned once every fortnight and that was not an issue for us overall i am happy to have been able to return to royal plaza after and a half years
422,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,colour your guests according to your website you pride yourselves in living your brand values to colour your guests colours is your acronym that helps your team remember how you guys do things differently with creativity ownership lovable opportunity unexpected real and sincerity i recently stayed at your hotel for nights on a business trip on th july i checked into your hotel and was assigned to room upon entering the room i found the room was rather noisy as it is located next to the lift well with constant rumbling noise caused by the movements of the lifts i then requested a for a room change and was given a new room at while shifting my belongings from the old room to the new room i had forgotten to remove my insulin injection medicine which i had
423,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good location stayed here for days with my daughter the room is quite spacious for the price and the location the location is very good walking distance to famous orchard road however they dont provide bell service and housekeeping for the room cleaning to minimize interactions due to covid but we can still ask for amenities room service is only until pm if im not mistaken overall good visit will definitely come back
424,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,standards have dropped badly there are two things this hotel has going in its favour first the reception staff they are very polite and warm and they try to help this broken hotel to function second the location you are in the heart of the shopping action in the orchard district also there is a starbucks literally outside the front door sadly this is where the positives end the hotel feels very basic and cheap our room was barely the standard of room at a hotel ibis or premier inn the tacky plasticfaux leather sofa chair epitomised the room a console you would at expect with an ice cooler coffee machine mini bar kettle ectthat was non existent instead of some those were tucked into cheap fitted shelving unit perhaps the biggest let down is that housekeeping do not clean the rooms
425,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,incredibly cheap hotel i have stayed at the royal scott many times over thirty years and it has always been a cheap hotel but now it has gotten crazy im sorry sir but since you are staying two nights we dont clean your room no towels no amenities no room services no cleaning and more than us per night needless to say they will be eternally crossed on my personal and corporate stay list in singapore covid apparently did not teach these operators a lesson in customer loyalty what incredible cheapskates
426,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,no sparkle left we have stayed here on multiple occasions and enjoyed it tremendously but alas think its now over we used to rave about the breakfast but guess covid has killed it it is now just very basic and would probably give this alone a star rating there was no towel change during our day stay tea and coffee per day was our allowance in the room the hotel gives you a feeling its on a downward trend and will take a big kick up the backside to motivate into its past glory
427,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,horrible breakfast of all the many hotels we stayed this had the most horrible breakfast not many edible variety butter president brand was horrible and its the only one they gave coffee machine not working when it works dispense halfway only kind of fried noodle for this kind of price breakfast at macdonald is way so much better
428,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good location for shopping in orchard road and the halal buffet breakfast was great we stayed in room and checkedin was slow it took us about mins to finally checked in although there were counters open there was not much to do in the hotel as the swimming pool and gym were closed for servicing the coworking space access which comes with our room is also a little blah with just coffee and tea and some cookies in a jar for refreshments overall room is clean spacious and comes with a bathtub the halal breakfast spread is the highlight of the stay with a good variety of delicious food served
429,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great hospitality smiling staff and very strategic location hotel with strategic location near to mrt and isetan within walking distance staff provides best hospitality services despite of minimum manning in the hotel my special thanks to katrina and dragon who have helped us during our stay from may until june also the helpful housekeeping team idris marcus and rocky they helped a lot in refilling our daily needs due to the alternate days of cleaning my parents just got eye operation and needed bed rest and they really enjoyed the services we wish to return to royal plaza if we had a chance to return to singapore
430,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,clean and quiet check in busy hence slow seemed understaffed rooms clean aircon cold enough phone answering eg when we call to ask for towels took forever for staff to answer we went down to receptionist to ask wifi speed good water in toilet good clear breakfast as usual good variety but one gets bored of it after the nd day would we stay again yes location convenient
431,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,school holiday staycation its been awhile since family goes for a trip so for now staycation with family great experience i must say checkin in was fast and efficient location is awesome as ion orchard etc all nearby thumbs up for the fo staff seri attending to us
432,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,stay away from this hotel paid star price but star service their is no bellboyconcierge to help you with your bags imagine you are travelling with the elders no house keeping if you are staying days and below no fresh towels absolute rip off should have told us earlier and we wont be bother booking at all avoid usd pernight for a twin room to the mangment who is reading this my itinerary was r i think for the price i deserve slight attention bad way of doing business
433,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,stars hotel downgraded to stars services i was with my year old parents for a short holiday we have been a loyal customers for many years it has always give us a fantastic service with friendly porters and concierges but when we arrived to the hotel this time we were so shocked that there are no porters to help us with our luggages we have to carry all luggages to the room my parents are years old if i am not with my parents they are not capable to carry the heavy luggages we have paid for stars services and in return they gave us a star service i would have gone for a cheaper hotel if i have known there are no porters to help the hotel services is so poor we do not get our rooms clean everyday is only every alternate days that they will clean the rooms it wasnt like that years ago
434,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,alot better than those bad reviews given no make up of room no problem can always call housekeeping to replenish what you need breakfast varieties limited or not much changes come on most hotels are the same push your own luggages carts are provided i had staycayed in many other big hotels that didnt provide such service even wifi indicated that it was limited to devices only with people holding so many gadgets they should not limit to just i brought my own apple tv box to hook up it was so easy with the wifi connection some hotel required me to call their it dept to set up my ip address to gain access stayed in executive suite allowed up to adults using the existing sofa bed paid less than extra in total for nights and it included breakfast too they would set
435,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,enjoyable first staycation at this hotel overall its good service is great location is very convenient to places in orchard area the room is a little old and it feels like the hotel is still in shn mode with a cabinet placed outside each room which i think it is still serving shn guest the back door from the hotel carpark was not accessible during our stay so dragging a luggage from tbe carpark to the lobby wasnt the easiest
436,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,staycation dn royal plaza on scotts disappointed standard upgrade my room to primer but looks like normal deluxe room pkt of tea pkt of coffee bottle of mineral waterthats all breakfast is really lousy its a very simple basic breakfast omg grand hyatt is much more better my first last staying here
437,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,the most disappointing hotel we have ever stayed in the plaza hotel on scotts was the start of a th birthday holiday for my partner from the start we were disappointed we always book a city hotel with pool to be able to relax in at the end of a day sightseeing we were informed on the friday before we travelled that the pool is currently closed we were told this was for maintenance repairs but as this hotel is being used as an isolation hotel for travellers it felt that this was closed as a result of the hotels policy regarding covid more importantly there was no housekeeping provided in the room towels were not changed and dirty cups were left we had to take these items to the housekeeping ourselves to request clean items to take back to our room on speaking with the management i was advised that this was to
438,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,was okay where do i begin i was offended before i could even enter the hotel for my staycation i arrived with a backpack and suitcase was crowded went up the stairs tapped the token and headed for the door before i could reach the door the staff stopped me and asked if i was there for a staycation i said yes and she asked me for the confirmation i was like right here outside the door and right now isnt that the duty of the reception staff or concierge why is the staff checking on trace together scans asking for confirmation details outside the hotel in view of everyone else so i took out my mobile went into the app and showed her i had the common sense to move aside else i would be blocking the entrance the online registration eased some parts of the
439,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,avoid simply put the worst hotel experience ever read all the star reviews all tell the truth they use the covid situation to hide behind terrible service if they cant operate as a hotel should they shouldnt have international travellers their excuse when complaints are made is its on the website well its on their website that they are not used for quarantine purposes yet when you enter the foyer there was a board saying that there are guests who are quaranting theyll take the money but wont give the service and in our case almost took our vacation thankfully the maldives gave us everlasting memories
440,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,disappointing stay disappointing stay i think royal plaza on scotts is not ready to reopen the room smelt musty toilet bowl is filled with dirt despite few flushes the water from the tap in both rooms is yellow we informed the reception and they did send maintanence to service it the mainthe next day the same thing happened we informed reception again and was told to let the water run for a while we let the water run for mins and yet its still rusty colour we gave up i think something as basic as water must be clean for the guests we have emailed the hotel to give feedback but no reply to date
441,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,dissappointment staycation due to overwhelming guests reservations we were given options for bento sets instead of buffet breakfast which may take a super long wait dissappointed with the arrangement and poor management as they should have forseen the situation tvs remote control plastic cover was not replaced staycation joy with grsndchildren turned sour
442,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,no complains i had a one night stay here as a surprise from my husband for my birthday checkin was a breezethankfully hotel surprised me with a slice of birthday cakesuch a sweet gesture we arrived in our room kn the th floor and it was clean and quiet perfect for those who wants a good rest very cosy room size is okaybut i find that the room service menu was not very extensive but its okay as were in orchard rdplenty of food options to go toget delivery from bathrooms have bidetand they included basic toiletries too we went fr the buffet breakfast at carousel not much variety but the food was warm delicious nonetheless take note that they have a novisitor policy just in case some of you want to have friends over
443,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,fall from grace i booked a night stay at this hotel on february and in retrospect it seemed like they just reopened prior to checkin ive made a call to the hotel to enquire if my booking went through as i didnt receive an immediate confirmation email in fact until today i still have not received a confirmation email or invoice and to make queries on a special request i was taken aback at the rude and patronising tone from the operator that served me during the call and could clearly remember her telling me that the hotel does not entertain such requests anymore and tried to shut me down by telling me that if i wanted to request for an early checkin i would have to check out earlier the next day to compensate for the time to sum it up it was a horrifying and unnecessary
444,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,a horrible staycation hotel one which seeks to cut corners under the pretext of covidrelated risk mitigation policies our stay at royal plaza on scotts was perhaps the worst experience weve had in a so called luxury hotel in singapore despite charging rates which were not too dissimilar to other luxury hotels in the vicinity there was a complete disconnect in the services provided to guests as follows there wasnt anyone to assist with our luggage upon disembarkation from our vehicle at the hotel lobby in fact we were told to use hotel provided trolleys to load the bags ourselves and wheel it over to the reception area checkingin was completely inefficient we waited close to minutes despite there only being one other person in the line in front of us thereafter the receptionist took over minutes to process our checkin at checkin which was also apparently
445,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,shn facilities just tried to drop some frozen food and a microwave to someone doing their shn there to be told there was a rule that nothing could be sent to the rooms to heat up food how ridiculous and backward is that swisshotel allowed it and many of the hotels actually rent out microwaves to their shn guests no reasoning was given just a blank stare and repeated that its not allowed given that the food is pretty appalling and usually cold by the time it reaches the room its crazy the least they could do is allow microwaves i will never voluntarily patronise this hotel
446,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,utterly appalling we stayed here for shn dictated by the authorities i felt like a prisoner from the minute i arrived at the airport and it has not changed from that day checkin incredibly rude and very unhelpful but suitable staff for this appalling standard of hotel food was inedible and we lived on delivered food from outside i created a blog for evidence towels service only when you asked and same with bedlinen and we had to change ourselves we paid nearly sgd to be treated like someone at changi prison except in prison they get exercise here we got nothing
447,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,could be better we were assigned here for shn got off to a bad start when our bus had to wait hour mins outside the hotel for some reason not what you want after a hour flight etc we were never told we had to wait or why and it took a lot of comparing for person to even use a toilet this was rd world service check in was prompt but on arrival to our room discovered only bedside table as the nd had to be placed outside our door to receive food etc weeks without a phonebook etc beside our bed wasnt acceptable so i moved the second table back inside and let the hotel sort it out room was spacious and clean but the window looked straight into a migrant workers bathroom so curtains were drawn all the time food was hit and miss i recognise that cooking for so many
448,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,bad experience during my quarantine time i came back from jakarta and had to serve my shn at royal plaza on scotts i stayed there for weeks my mom packed some frozen foods we thought my wife could go there and fetch the food through the hotel concierge little did we know that nothing can go out from the hotel except for medicine but everything can come in so if you bring any medicine you can pass it to your family or friends through the hotel concierge medicine can cooked and frozen food cant really weird i tried to talk to them but one of the lady at the reception was giving me sour face and talked in an impolite way she was rather looked annoyed with me what a professional hotel staff huh gok so i called and even emailed the gm general manager unfortunately he didnt reply but the front
449,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,shn i could not have asked for a better hotel to do my quarantine the food was really good staff were so helpful and kind im looking forward to visiting their restaurant when all reopens the desserts were super as were breakfast pancakes
450,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,nice hotel suite for quarantine we booked the suite for our days quarantine on our return from overseas the sqm space is divided into a living area and a bedroom with attached bathroom both areas are spacious theres a bathtub and rain shower provided although were not allowed out the food in bento boxes are palatable much better than expected clean linens and fresh bath towels etc were promptly sent to us when requested the choice to stay here has made our quarantine easier to pass
451,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,during shn no dinner and breakfast been provided until you called their receptionist shn in this hotel checked in yesterday and no dinner been provided until i called and asked same for todays morning breakfast poor service dissappointed with their food management team even though food is good
452,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great experience at the royal plaza on scotts singapore after having done my quarantine in several hotels it was by far the best stay i had a wonderful experience at the royal plaza on scotts singapore first of all my room was very clean and comfortable the good thing about the room is that you can open the window also the staff was great they went over and beyond to help make my stay enjoyable with my food request finally the food is really good i highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting singapore thank you i will recommend to my friends and colleagues
453,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice roomservicelocation noisy room is very spacious good service from reception the restuarant carousel is halal food is quite nice but there is always noise coming from the main street nearby and nowhere cannot sleep i wont say i am super sensitive to noise
454,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,booked months ahead but hotel cancelled without informing though i can appreciate if they need to use the hotel for shn but the claim that they did not have my contact details not even my email which i used to book is laughable i dread to think what would have happened if i had no need to contact the hotel was going to ask about breakfast had to send a new contact form before anyone would reply if you cant handle shn dont open your hotel for bookings at all you just lost customers because you have no idea how to retain lousy email address
455,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,staff chose to burn a regular customer i flew into singapore at am and despite being a regular customer they wouldnt allow me to check in they had rooms available because i could pay for an extra day but they chose to burn the relationship when i did check in i got one of their car park view rooms there are plenty of hotels that understand real service and reciprocity not this place though
456,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,days stay home notice quarantine after return from france today i just want to congratulate you on the quality of service you provide to your shn customers of which i am currently a part compared to other hotels in which i have already been in quarantine i assure you that your service is by far the best quality and friendliness of your teams both at reception and in room service standard of your rooms with opening windows essential for shn the quality of your cooking even if i am spoiled by friends who often make me good dinners and especially your pastry thanks to all the royal plaza on scotts team
457,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,very average i am posting the review again as in my fury posted with a new profile and not my existing one yes they goofed up big time with my food on my first day of stay at home quarantine did not serve me dinner till pm instead of to pm and delayed my grab food delivery by mins rendering it tasteless and cold that was very disappointing but on the balance once i have calmed down the rest rooms are ok view is sad staff at check in very courteous and quality of in room amnesties above average sometimes the standard meals pretty good so on the balance they are average and not as bad as i initially blurred out makes you realise services are very perceptive and how you handle moments of truth frames the users experience and rating of youwont be paying my own
458,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,terrible despicable horrible royal i checked in for my quarantine shm stay the first day never got food for dinner delivery time of nothing came by pm ordered on grab food they lost my food or the staff ate itha ha the modest royal hotel in kl where i did my quarantine in kl is x better then this bunch of idiots just as i was typing my original meal arrived no sign of my grab delivery yet
459,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,beautifully managed lovely hotel in the city lovely property managed very well teally great staff and beautifully furnished comfy rooms woth a great mini bar service awsome restaraunt and breakfast one should never miss whilst in singapore since its close to orchard road and far east plaza even shopping from here is not a problem for sure a star property in my book well done team from door to gm makes you feel at home and welcome
460,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,validity of vouchers good things first i love this place this hotel has a great reputation nice food carousel youre great and convenient location personally ive not stayed here before but ive visited the carousel buffet a couple of times and it never fails to impress me now unfortunately the bad ive had some vouchers that i have been intending to redeem but unfortunately due to covid i was unable to visit the hotel as the vouchers were expiring in november i wrote to roomres for help in extending the validity during july hoping that the hotel will understand my concerns the roomres team requested for a photo of my vouchers so that they can ask their management for approval which i gladly obliged thinking all was good as they said that they understood my concerns in
461,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,expect the equivalent of a us sheraton with a lot of people and it will be fine i wasnt crazy about this place it reminds me of the sheratons in the us which is okay but its not a five start hotel by us standards first they were late for house cleaning one day and didnt come until pm because they were busy also my view was of an apartment building where i saw laundry hanging i had no privacy so had to keep my curtains closed theyre close to the mrt but its still of a mil to get to the actual entrance to the mrt and its super hot there so thats kind of a bigger deal than you might think if you want to cross the street its a big deal youll need to go underground and figure out how to get across in the maze its okay if you have a lot of time they did not offer a room service menu its easy to hear the doors closing on other
462,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,not up to the standards of other or star hotels in singapore our stay at the royal plaza on scotts was in february the first impression of the hotel was good very good in fact but the first evening when we visited the hotels premier lounge we were really dissapointed the lounge was completely empty and for a reason there were only coffee and tea and some cookies and nuts thats all if you wanted anything to eat or drink you had to buy it from the menu having paid a higher rate to get a larger room have breaksfast included and the access to the hotels lounge we really feel that this service was not up to the standards of any or star hotels in singapore or any other country breakfast buffet was served in the restaurant at the lobby it was good but repetitive everyday the selection of plates was the same and
463,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,early christmas the location is close to ion orchard and other shopping centers because i want to enjoy the christmas atmosphere in singapore the location of this hotel is the best i think not too expensive clean hotel friendly service but when i stayed the hotel was quite crowded
464,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,ideal location friendly staff ideal location very near subway station orchard club room good with the gentlemen in the club lounge very friendly and accomodating staff on reception exceptional going beyond to contact the airline regarding lost kindle food in restaurant plantiful and varied if very busy
465,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,staycation during covid we booked a one night stay at this hotel to chill out and shop along orchard road on a weekday which we seldom have the chance to do during normal days the s price tag comes with breakfast for at the highly acclaimed carousel cafe and also free access to the premier lounge so we thought it was quite a good deal the location was great especially after a long day of shopping and dinner we didnt use the pool as it was small and boring the premier lounge was a disappointment as there were only machine coffee teabags machine soft drinks peanutspotato chips and some biscuits no finger food alcohol or can drinks that you can bring back to your room the room was small but ok the aircon has a damp smell but we bear with it carousel is grossly overrated as the
466,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,good room but disappointing in every other aspect stayed with a group of friends using the what the duck promotion was pleasantly surprised at how nice the renovated premier rooms are and with a bathtub unfortunately the good things about this hotel ends here room service was terrible the lady on the phone was extremely rude when i asked for extra towels she challenged me as to why i needed extra towels and only relented to give me after much back and forth the premier lounge is a complete joke with only some biscuits and juices the crowd was so big that we had difficulty finding a time to sit no canapés breakfast alcoholic beverages to speak of breakfast was very crowded and we had to wait more than minutes to get in spread was highly uninspiring gym and pool were also unacceptably small and outdated
467,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,ok and average nothing fancy nor memorable more can be improved especially the suite rooms and premiere lounge good thing is the checkin and checkout as the front office staff were friendly and efficient location is the main draw to this hotel
468,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great for staycation good location spacious room comfortable bed nothing much to complain about the room could improve on crowd control the queue for the breakfast buffet and check out was really long may want to consider express checkout service for local guests
469,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,thank you the rooms were spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable my family had a wonderful staycation with royal plaza on scotts thank you for your warm hospitality and service we look forward to comeback once again
470,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great stay we had a great stay at royal plaza location was great staff were friendly room was very clean breakfast was very good but too bad the dinner is fully booked and we couldnt experience dinner at carousel
471,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,okayish hotel with good staff royal plaza on scotts is surely not a star hotel the pool is really small and rooms are just standard size checkin process is efficient even though there is big weekend crowd likewise another long queue for breakfast over weekend but the staff managed this crowd well for those with young children and especially thinking of staycation the swimming pool size would be big disappointment also there are no kids channels on tv and no other amenities like children playrooms etc few other letdowns are the notsoclean bedsheets muchhyped free mini bar that comes with bottles of water and small cups of juice gym with half of the equipment under maintenance the room given to us doesnt have any view but the hotel is in city center so cant complain much
472,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,queuecation not staycation i booked rooms for a family staycation unfortunately much of my stay was spent in crowded queues queue for check in queue for breakfast safe distancing was not observed and i truly felt concerned and guilty for exposing my family to increased health risk by booking this stay at royal plaza at scotts management could have planned in advance to increase front office capacity and allocated additional breakfast venues given the high bookings they have received during the march holidays and in view of government social distancing measures i ended up foregoing the inclusive breakfast and checked out early at am for the sake of my familys health and pushed financial considerations aside poor crowd control and planning not what we need to help us fight the
473,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,poor crowd control we booked two rooms and were extremely alarmed to arrive at the hotel and be faced with such a crowd at a time where social distancing is highly recommend even in house guests were not able to dine at the in house buffet restaurant due to an excessively generous promotion for all patrons we ended up cancelling the stay since the in house restaurant gym pool are all unavailable we are impressed by the front desk teams patience in the face of such a crowd i believe the reservations and marketing team failed to limit the rooms for their promotion and were instead chasing numbers sadly this has brought down the brand image of an otherwise reputable hotel along orchard road
474,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,perfect for staycation stayed nights for the local resident promotion rooms are reasonably big and location is very good very near to far east plaza and shaw centre breakfast buffet has very good spread and the lounge on th floor is wellmaintained nice pineapple cookies there is also a h gym that is very useful for fitness buffs please continue to have promotions for locals thank you
475,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,perfect venue for staycation location is amazing as its located at prime orchard road room is newly renovated and spacious and the bed was divine breakfast at carousel was a treat and service staff was friendly and approachable definitely will stay here again
476,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great location royal plaza on scotts is a lovely hotel in a great location close to orchard road and conveniently close to shopping malls restaurants and the hop on hop off bus the staff were helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble we really enjoyed our stay
477,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,heartless in a time of need i was due to visit singapore on the way to a medical conference overseas the conference was cancelled due to the coronavirus and as a medical professional i have been asked to stay in australia to assist with the current situation also the government has directed for the st time in history do not travel despite this this hotel would not allow me to reschedule to the new conference date in september instead they took my money and said there was no reason i could still not come all of my other bookings i have had to cancel for this trip and others planned have allowed free cancellation or at least a free rebook not this hotel
478,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,awesome staycay stayed during the what the duck promo was upgraded to premiere room for free also had access to the premiere lounge great room with good pillows and air con breakfast wise was ok if there was enough service staff to fill up the food trays timely i love how warm the reception staff were
479,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,a fantastic stay thank you we had a club room on the th floor and our door was right opposite the doors to the club lounge hotel service was excellent breakfast was excellent but a little too predictable and the club lounge was a great place to just sit and think and plan the next day of activities we will be back again thanks again for a great stay
480,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,fantastic stay fantastic stay with a superb breakfast the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the shopping area in orchard road the dining experience for breakfast and dinner exceeded our expectations and we will return for another stay

482,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,love my stay the room was clean tidy and spacious bed was very comfortable it was very welcoming when we entered the room as the tv was automatically on with background soothing music the location was great as it is at the town area more shopping easy access to food
483,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great stay excellent stay at the hotel will always look forward to return another thing great about this hotel was it has a halal restaurant called carousel which is perfect good location near the exciting malls and great to just walk around orchard
484,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great property at a prime location the property is beautifully built and is at a prime location less than km from little india there are shopping places nearby the hotel as well amenities are very nice comfortable family stay the hotel wifi ws also nice
485,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,staycation with young children perfect location and nearby eateries and shopping mall staff are polite and friendly starbucks are just outside the main lobby which is great for coffee lover however it would be more ideal if there is a children pool or playground
486,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,great location but fail to impress booked the hotel for a staycation and this is the first time in all my years of staycation that i am so disappointed quote from website at royal plaza on scotts we make every effort to make your hotel stay in singapore and dining experience memorable indeed memorable and its not good kind firstly location of hotel is great upon checking into our room we are quite happy with the amenities and that it is a smoke free hotel we visited the premium lounge on th floor and sad to say that it is far from premium experience as compared to another hotel in chinatown their club lounge has better service and light refreshment that makes the stay more comfortable we also visited its pool the journey to the pool seems like a walk into time machine and you feel like
487,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not a kid friendly hotel no kids channel on tv and problem with ac hot water and wifi other than that location is great at the heart of orchard road booked a suite n wished it was slightly more bigger hotel staffs are friendly and smiley
488,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good pick for a day stay in singapore we wanted a good quality hotel located near the mrt and were pleased with our stay here you can get the mrt from changi to orchard which is m from the hotel or the bus which drops off just around the corner maybe m or a metered taxi which at pm cost us s and the grab car back at pm cost s download the grab app before you go just like uber make sure you get a tourist travel card from the mrt ticket office as this is very cheap to use for your stay and the mrt and buses are very efficient the staff were excellent our room on the rd floor was comfortable just a couple of comments common to most hotels there is no drawer space so you live out of a suitcase the listing sold a free mini bar which is in fact just water that needs to be changed the
489,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,very good recommended hotels best price performance location near top notch mall have a personal bus stop station near mrt station near movie theaters my experience i can check in start from am without additional payment what a surprise
490,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,what the duck staycation value for money deal not to be missed by singaporeans who want to get away amidst covid they take care of you and ensure social responsibility is looked into with temperature screening and contact tracing
491,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,pleasant layover in royal plaza on scotts overall very happy with my choice of hotel i stayed at the royal plaza on the recommendation from my sister in law who stays regularly when working in singapore management institute i was well pleased
492,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,always at the top notch location friendly clean rooms and hotel corridors breakfast variety that changes everyday in some section not all but some fast elevators high speed wifi and the best thing is that they provide portable wifi with good connection a little hassle to connect i need to ask assistance from the front desk though because you need to download an app despite of all the goodness about the hotel and the comfortable stay it lost its hositality touch from the staff me and my family barely got any greetings from them
493,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,will only stay here the location was amazing walking distance to all the prime locations the utilities are new and well kept the staff are really friendly and helpful and the restaurant is a halal restaurant also they provide free pocket wifi which makes the whole experience worth it thank you
494,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,will come back again the room rate was really attractive with free upgrade to premier room there is light snack eg nuts biscuits and chips in the premier lounge all day long and guest could select from a range of hot and cold beverages however unlike the premier lounges in other hotels this one does not serve evening cocktail overall its a great staycation where service staff is friendly and location is fantastic
495,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,stayed two nightswished wed planned for more we stayed at this property for two nights before our asian cruise to get over our long flight and to experience singapore super glad we did and wished we had planned for more days a great hotel super friendly and helpful staff our luggage did not arrive with us on our flight missed the connecting flight the concierge staff were very proactive and helpful in following up with the delivery company for us very spacious quiet room and wonderful buffet breakfast
496,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,lovely hotel great location stayed here at the start of the coronavirus situation and every time we entered the hotel they took our temperatures a proactive approach which was very good our room was spacious the bed really comfortable breakfast selection really good and tasty every member of staff was excellent smiling and they could not do enough for us there is a small iphone sized box in each room that you set then carry in your pocket which gives free internet access in singapore wherever you travel reception staff set this up for me and i was good to go location is great only a minute to the mrt and orchard rd with its plethora of shops and restaurants oh and we used the pool on th floor quite enclosed but comfy sun beds and free coffee machine by it
497,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not for tourists dont be fooled by the stunning entrance the room although spacious and spotlessly clean lacked facilities there was only hanging space for clothes and no drawer space so we basically lived out of our suitcase minimal tea and coffee in the room but only coffeemate so had to go out and buy milk for tea there was no tourist information available for places to go and we had to ask for a map the only bar was a very small area on the st floor open from pm till pm so nowhere to sit and relax i had asked on booking for a room on a low floor as i do not care for lifts and preferred to use the stairs on arrival i was taken through the kitchens to a back staircase to get to the th floor i did find a better route by myself but having asked the question about stairs
498,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,need more improvement i booked a suite for my husbands birthday check in is just as ordinary the room is big clean and pleasant the breakfast at carousel is average did not meet expectation overall experience this time round is average

502,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,bedtype did not meet expectation as stated in the checkin voucher the bedtype of single beds instead of a queen bed was in fact not available nor registered in the hotel system although it was booked with this specific request online i think tripcom and the hotel should have communicated clearly with no ambiguity and inconsistent information in online booking system
503,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,opposite of grand hyat in the heart of singapore near to mrt orchard without rain effect of walking tourist this hotel is perfect for surounding orchard opoosite of grand hyatt and far eastplaza room is spacious rain shower deep sleep bed branded bathbamenities big lobby very good breakfast fast check in and express check out sin is similar pleasure free internet room value
504,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,love it our overall experience was good hotel room was nice n the staff was friendly as well only housekeeping was a bit slow and our portable wifi was not in a good condition the battery needs to be charged all the time other than that all was good
505,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,business trip in singapore rooms okay facilities for working can be improved lobby very noisy breakfast is good i did not try room service nor restaurant for lunch or dinner good location and very handy for shopping and moving with public transport
506,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good and comfortable stay booked and stay the royal plaza on scotts corporate suite the room was huge to accommodate me and my guests the room is clean and comfortable with a big bathroom and super king bed will definitely stay again in the future
507,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,easy singapore stopover a nice hotel with helpful staff the bed was very comfortable awesome shower very convenient location lots of shops nearby only issue was our childrens room was several rooms down the corridor and we would have preferred it closer
508,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,my must go to hotel when in singapore be it for leisure or for work i cant stray away from rp on scotts location service room quality and comfort have always been consistently maintained ability to stow our bags during the need for early checkouts w late flights have always been accomodating to different type of travelers halal buffet breakfast and dinners make it easy for muslim travelers to have meals with the hotel be it at their restaurants or as room service orders it is pricey considering all of the factors but worth every penny
509,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great ultra clean room with plenty of space and brand spanking new the restaurant looked very busy all the time and seems to be having high awards staff efficient and location great recommended for couples and singles
510,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,wonderful experience i am happy to have chosen this hotel for a staycation checkin and checkout was a breeze one breakfast buffer wide variety nothing else that i could ask for more i will come back for smore staycations in this hotel
511,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent hotel from the moment we were greeted at the door until the doorman hailed our departing taxi the service staff facilities breakfast buffet were superb the room was large bathroom included a bath the bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in the pool was clean and towels were provided staff very friendly polite and always happy to help
512,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good clean hotel conveniently located near to shopping district pleasant hotel with comfortable beds and friendly staff but a little lacking in character or atmosphere ok for an overnight stay but would personally prefer somewhere that you can relax in with a little more going on than the uninspiring but efficient public areas
513,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,bad experience good things about this hotel location friendly staff pocket wifi no need to buy local simcard bad things very ordinary breakfast no changes in menu during my stays food taste soso only like singapore soup ask the staff to change bed sheet but she didnt understand so your staff didnt change the sheet experienced annoying sounds at night and dawn
514,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,dissatisfy dissatisfied this time it was surprisingly dissatisfiedno action was taken regarding an unnecessary situation at the breakfast buffet even after we complainedwe have been staying der fr years and we were expecting more then wt they provided this time
515,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great location price we had a nice stay here over xmas and the kids enjoyed the pool with easy access to all transport links and shops visit the newton open food court which is only a short walkway metro is also very close as are the main shops
516,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great hotel great location my wife and i stayed here for nights and gave it a top rating because for the money i think it is a great hotel we were toying with paying substantially more to stay at the marina bay sands but glad we picked this instead the rooms are a good size and quiet which was important for us and the location was just off orchard road with a short walk to the mrt station the taxi ride from the airport was minutes and i downloaded the grab app so the cost was only we didnt end up using the pool or gym but both looked good for a city centre hotel
517,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,not as good as before i used to stay at this hotel quite often one of the reasons was that there were several choices of free drinks provided in the rooms fridge soft drinks juices and even bir bintang i noticed that the owner of this hotel has changed because some of the services that were previously provided are now reduced or even no longer provided such as the free drinks now only provided small cups of juice and bottles of water on the first day instead of bottles on other days when i arrived at the hotel and it was already pm the room was not ready until pm while the check in time should be at the amenities were also lacking only small bottle of shampoo and also other toiletries was provided on the first day which was not enough to use for persons the
518,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,nye carousel buffet excellent went as a family of including teenage girls for their new years eve buffet had emailed before we arrived in singapore and initially had to be put on the wait list but the staff managed to secure us a table the day before nye from the minute we walked in the staff and the experience was great loads of lovely food of every continent culture highly recommended
519,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,our stay a very nice hotel to stay in from our arrival the staff were very helpful and friendly its handy location to orchard road and other locations makes it an ideal venue rooms very clean and comfortable beds
520,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,great location but didnt feel very welcomed we stayed recently with our kids arrived at the hotel with our reservation in hand and hotel didnt have record of it they managed to find a room and the reservation in the back end but were not apologetic despite having booked months in advance not the kind of service expected when paying over a night room was fine great aircon and location is excellent for orchard rd its a clean average hotel but stayed in other properties in singapore where staff are a lot more welcoming and service much better mention must be given to the doorman who was the only friendly staff member we spoke with
521,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,singapore stay premium room not so good we stayed at the premium room for nights the first nights were staying on the th floor checkin was quick disappointed with the room due to loud noise and smoke fume from next door room smoke came in through the connecting door despite of nonsmoking floor the next day we moved and were located to more quieter room we had access to the royal club lounge on the th floor for some refreshments and snacks which was great room was quite large with basic amenities provided and staff were helpful location is near orchard road with ion and isetan are a few steps away
522,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good experience location was excellent staff was helpful and services were very good room service was quick unlike most hotels room was clean and comfortable and the only place i know who provides a free mini bar
523,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,our second stay great hotel excellent location love this hotel location is great being close to ion shopping centre and mrt along with other shopping centres within walking distance rooms tidy and clean and staff always helpful we ate at carousel restaurant for new years eve dinner it was excellent top quality seafood and other dishes service was great and definitely value for money surprising how quiet the rooms were this time beds very comfortable
524,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,royal plaza on scotts road december stay an excellent stay at a venue we consider our home from home in singapore we were very well received and shown to our room despite arriving very early in the morning rooms are usually only available after pm on day of arrival staff were polite and helpful rooms well appointed breakfast selection on the premium floors is limited so we opted to have breakfast in the main dining hall on the ground floor because of the festive season the hotel was at capacity which created some congestion in the dining area food choice was excellent food quality was excellent we will recommend royal plaza on scotts road without doubt to any traveller we will also like to be kept informed of any special deals including flights if possible
525,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent the lobby itself already caught my eye its beautiful the hotel is strategically located near orchard mrt station and its near to ion mall the room is clean spacious bed is extremely comfy i had a perfect stay
526,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,what a let down this is not the first time my husband and i chose the royal plaza we came back to it because of the pleasant memories we had in the past however our recent stay was disappointing when we checked in we were told in a stern tone by the checkin staff that we had not paid so they took a fairly large amount from our credit card when we insisted that we had paid through our agent we were told that the hotel is unaware of this later we went back to sort this out and another staff asked to photocopy our itinerary and said that they will try to sort it out all this with not even a friendly tone or reassuring smile we then emailed our agent who swiftly sorted everything out for us and informed us via email unfortunately the hotel did not even assure us of this each day
527,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,best location excellent and friendly staff members location is superb and central to many big malls getting groceries is conveniently next door at isetan duty free mall is at the same building and convenient to get gifts
528,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent excellent service very satisfied will always stay in royal plaza if we visit singapore we have been loyal customer for years also love the free minibar location wise its a short walking distance to ion
529,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,exceptional service what makes royal plaza stand out is the exceptional service rendered by all staff every department exudes a positive energy towards pleasing their guests and this makes all the difference in addition the hotel is very conveniently located on orchard road making conveyance very easy the newly refurbished room was spacious and clean i stayed in room which met my expectations royal plaza will continue to be my choice of preference when in singapore
530,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,holiday bath tub should be equipped w mobiledetachable shower head for the ease of showering young kid which i specifically asked for during booking via email but was told none of premier room has it upon check in hence a bit of disappointment
531,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,royal plaza on scotts ive stayed at royal plaza on scoots several times my last stay was on the th th dec i was in singapore for business convenient location near the orchard mrt just a little walk through shaw center always love staying here always happy with all the super friendly hotel staff from the entrance to the receptionist on this stay i didnt take breakfast at the hotel but as i recalled staying the last time the food was all delicious i really liked it thank you royal plaza for your hospitality will definitely come back again
532,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,wonderful christmas experience great experience in royal plaza on scotts looking forward in staying at this hotel i hope you will continue providing excellent service to all merry christmas and a happy new year to the royal plaza staff
533,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nights family vacation location is ok close to ion mrt staff was friendly and helpful room carpet could have been cleaner other areas are clean breakfast was a bit boring after nd day need more variation complimentary pocket wifi nespresso and minibar was a plus
534,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,family holiday excellent location friendly staff and spacious room just found the air conditioning at night to be fluctuating quite a bit which caused a bit of disturbance the rain shower head needs a deeply cleaning but otherwise a very clean room children loved the free drinks and the adults enjoyed the nepresso would prefer more kid friendly tv channels and the pool room needs to be better staffed overall stay was very enjoyable and will definitely be back
535,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,ever friendly staff at royal plaza on scotts this was the second time i checked in at royal plazathe staff were very welcoming and i really like the welllit corridors leading to the rooms buffet breakfast was awesome especially the range of fresh fruits prepared in the customers view not the ones cut and chilled overnight
536,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good location and good hotel to stay first of all the location is great right in heart of orchard very near to mrt shopping malls restaurants and touristy place checkin and checkout time is average didnt take that long breakfast buffet selection are halal its nice but i feel that there are fewer selections the room is nice bright and modern furnishing with free pocket wifi complete with toiletries and complimentary drinks are plenty which is very surprising my only complaint is the bed its a little bit dusty and uncomfortable i keep on sneezing and didnt have a goodnight sleep i wish they can improve the cleanliness of the sheets
537,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,staycation stayed over one night the room is little bit smallas i expected the room should be bigger than i thought anyway we only stayed for one night the toilet looked little bit old but at least it cleaned the most important is the bed which is comfortable and make me sleep throughout my night
538,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,uncomfortable beddings and check in bed was not as expected for a star hotel check in was a hassle could have done better breakfast was not to my expectation the variety of breads were lesser than i expected i had a very good breakfast experence with a wide selection of breads in other hotels and they could make their own pratas instead of using instant ones
539,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,staycation we spent our christmas eve at royal plaza and had a wonderful stay the staff were friendly and the room was clean it was our first hotel stay in singapore the bad is that our room faced carpark view instead of city view
540,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great stay the hotel are clean renovated and great location staff are very helpful and friendly they serve variety of halal food toilets are clean and it has bidet i stayed with my family my children looks happy and they feel comfortable staying at the hotel if only the rooms have connecting door inside that will be a bonus
541,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,still good but we have stayed here many times over the last eight years and the hotel is still great but its the little things that make or break the stay they have changed how you can help yourself at breakfast normally you cook your toast and take the sachets of butter and spread to your table but now you have to butter your bread at the toaster as the spreads are now in bowls not sachets of course this creates crowding and mess especially dragging a spoon of honey over a metre from the bowl it came from and if you want strawberry you have to go to the waffle are to get a spoon load and i like to have a banana for breakfast too but there was none in fact whole pieces of fruit was very minimal but plenty of diced pieces were available because of this new set up i found my hands
542,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,royal plaza on scotts please take customer request seriously n you may gain a loyalist perhaps the request is meaningless to u but a big thing for me n my family i did not get connecting rooms during our recent holiday coz somebody in rp did not allocated to my request
543,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,dec nice bed are comfy and clean little crowded at lobby but have a good staff near mrt near cinema and shopping mall all is walking distance doesnt try the hotel breakfast because crowded in the morning fair price
544,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,すばらしいサービス it was our first time staying with royal plaza on scotts hotel singapore we stayed in for nights and it was amazing the service was great receptionists housekeeper and others were all being super helpful definitely staying in again
545,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,royal plaza on scotts bu review good location nice and clean rooms good staffs helped in all means it would be better if there is a coffee shop room service did not have selection of foods after halal food was important for me really recommend this hotel
546,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,strategically located this was not our first time staying at this hotel lately we have been choosing this hotel to stay on our trips to singapore we love to stay in the orchard road area since it has almost everything however the hotels there are getting more and more expensive while the rate of royal plaza on scotts is still reasonable the hotel itself is located on scotts road but its just minutes walk away from orchard road and orchard mrt it is very convenient even for people who have never been in singapore before the room was spacious and very clean the minibar was free the staff were polite i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who are visiting singapore
547,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good hotel to stay hotel was awesome great customer service dinner was awesome great location and everything is nice about the hotel only problem is theres so much receptionist but i called more than times from my room to no answer
548,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,fun and comfortable stay great location and we kept coming back for more it is the best location to everywhere we stayed for a week and are returning to the same hotel after our japan trip for a month the mini bar is very useful
549,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,cancelled my booking the idiots at this hotel cancelled my booking before i even stayed there do not waste time booking here because you will probably have to rebook somewhere else this was the last thing i needed before christmas
550,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,royal scot very good hotel the staff are very friendly and helpfull the price is reasonable the food is nice a blend of everything the facility is very nice good gym equipment and the swimming pool is very nice
551,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent amazingly friendly and helpful bell desk and concierge staff best location good value spacious room comfortable bed and refreshing shower good water pressure our favourite hotel in singapore always

553,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good choice in the heart of orchard the hotel located in the heart of shopping arcade singapore i had a good experience while staying here the staff was really helpful very generous in internet service and they had pocket wifi compliment during your stay
554,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great location great location to stay very near to shopping area near to mrt many shopping area within walking distance easy to get taxi people are friendly hope to be coming back to the same hotel again because easy excess to everywhere
555,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,solo day stay i have read on the good reviews so i decided to stay one day from pm on th dec there was some issues with the check in when i reached at am as the staff couldnt find my name in the system i only found out that this hotel has day use recently it couldnt be found on day use app previously i stayed at premier room which has a bathtub but it wasnt soundproof could hear kids crying outside overall it was good and i could access the premier lounge for free snacks were ok but the staff at the lounge didnt bother to see if i was there and were not very friendly
556,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,clean and comfortable an ordinary hotel of standard look and feel but importantly it is clean and comfortable convenient location just a stones throw from mrt station and the bustling orchard road which also means plenty of eateries around buffet breakfast was just alright nothing to shout about
557,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,i love rp my go to hotel in sg staff there were great even room service when i ordered food the lady who picked up and took my order was sweet the second meal i ordered through room service the man who took my order steak which was superb was kind to ensure my meal did not contain corn cos i am allergic to corn the bellmen were very kind to let me put my last minute shopping goodies into my luggage with privacy in the baggage storage
558,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good stay the location was good and the room was clean it came with free pocket wifi which was execellent however the beds if the twin sharing room was too high for children and had wooden edge that was not very children friendly
559,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,usually this hotel is great but this time it was ok only quite often we stayed in this hotel more than times in this time it was fine though steve the receptionist placed me and my teenaged kids in separate floors due to the hotel is fully booked the hiccup was checking out with dragon though he finally assisted me well i just know i am charged for an upgrade which i was sure i have cancelled the upgrade with steve when i knew the charges so next time i have to make sure no charges etc before going to my rooms
560,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,a strategic located hotel with star service good location friendly staffs responsive services and surrounded by all you need shopping and eating places always my first choice hotel when traveling to singapore recommended for those wanting cozy and friendly hotel environment
561,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,smoke free environment many hotels in singapore allow people to smoke in the hotel for non smokers it can be difficult to find a smoke free environment royal plaza is an excellent place to stay smoke free and excellent customer service
562,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great hotel great facilities restaurants and staff the room was exceptional big room quiet centrally located in singapore nice breakfast spread especially for muslim tourists shower and flow of water need to be looked into though
563,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,long queue to check in the hotel was greet with good welcoming upon arriving upon entering the lobby theres was only counter in processing check in that it create a long queue to check in apart from that is all good
564,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,why i keep returning to royal plaza on scotts i love the rooms its amenities services and noisy importantly the wide spread of breakfast buffetand halal of course recently the hotel went through a renovation process i love the new look of the hotel

593,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice and clean room we stayed on the th club floor the room was spacious nice and clean and so was bathroom the cocktail in the lounge was really bad the buffet breakfast was also not that good used to be the location was good i advise to book rooms only
594,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good the hotel location is good breakfast much more vegetable is better room hair drier is needed taxi service need to be raised call taxi for visitor is a good service tv programm can you give much more selection for chinese tv
595,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent as always i do not know how many times i have been staying in this hotel but every time i come back the quality never changes number one is neat and comfortable room with good internet connection and free mini bar the only downside is the rather small shower area that i can barely move this is because the bathroom has also the bathtub that i very rarely use whenever i stay in royal plaza number two is sumptuous and halal breakfast so i have plenty of choices and i can choose whatever foods i like without worrying about halal or not number three is location which is at the heart of singapore shopping centers and very close from mrt station that can take us anywhere in the country last but not least is services that are courteous and proper the the day i check in until the day i
596,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,a friendly hotel during checkin and checkout the kindness and detailed explanation of the staffes were excellent and the food quality of the restaurant was good and the service of the staples for taxihailing was excellent im sure its a hotel i want to find again
597,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,used to be better went there for halal breakfast but it was too the same everyday boring that u dont mind missing but praying area is great cleanliness is acceptable and services could have been better would i go back just maybe might want to consider next door w other hotel that provides halal breakfast too
598,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,so impressed met relatives in singapore and stayed hear for nights room was excellent and extremely clean décor and ambience also excellent staff polite courteous and helpful check in and out was smooth with a chance for an upgrade which once explained we accepted food was served buffet style and was bountiful especially the seafood buffet here was lobster crayfish mussels prawns scallops to say the least no alcohol served in the restaurant but this could be had in the bar prior to or after the evening meal breakfast was buffet style also and was again plentiful with a lot of of different cultures catered for price was really reasonable and the hotel was excellently located for the really busy orchard road shops will stay here again the pool and gym were ok but not tried by
599,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,quick vacation all went well though the variety of the food are few very few western foods the reception were all very helpful especially when i forgot my phone in the taxi and luckily the driver sent it back and the reception agreed to pay for it on my behalf i just forgot the name of the lady who assisted me shes a great help
600,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,unsatisfied i know singapore hotels are not cheap but plz i saw bug in bath room and pool that was too deep and narrow poolthe deepest part is mand no section there be careful but morning meal was okay
601,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,disappointed disappointed in food this time particularly in club room felt like we got leftovers from carousel same things served up every day and felt it wasnt worth the extra paid for club facilities drinks were great but food needs to go back to what it used to be like
602,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,well worth it price and location was fantastic booked it directly via their own website much cheaper than hotelscom etc and included breakfast the breakfast buffet could do with some variety as i noticed the same options over mornings we got a room upgrade but it was located behind the lifts got really noisy in the night
603,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice and clean room fast check in the room is clean and come with free minibar which is really good the location is good to stroll around in orchard neighborhood hotel provides pocket wifi so you can get connected wherever you go in singapore
604,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good stay facilities can improve on food options overall experience was very good hotel was very clean staff was very polite and helpful if hotel can add indian food options it would be very great so that people dont have to go out to search vegetarian food
605,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,very nice hotel very nice hotel newly refurnished very clean and very well situated next to the main shopping area the hotel is very well soundproof so at night you dont feel any kind of noise breakfast is very complete with a large choice of cold and hot dishes and pastry hotel employees are very nice professional and always smiley the only negative point i found are the pillows which are very thick and hard they should have softner pillows thats is way i didnt put stars the however mattress are excellent
606,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good for staying in singapore i stayed nights in royal plaza on scott where is in city center a number of shopping centers ie ion are close from the hotel and food markethawk center is also not far from there unfortunately sport facilities lanes of swmming pool and small gym are lower than my expectation
607,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,my stay quite poor most of the upgrade appears superficial the feeling of things being money orientated was very evident really wanted it to be better than it was really believe everything laid out was not with europeans in mind
608,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,cant go wrong with this hotel i have been coming back to this hotel for years i always stay in one of their club rooms great service great food excellent service the mrt and bus services are just outside the hotel there are shops restaurants and food courts within walking distance i love this place because its very central yet away from the orchard crowd but most of all i love the service they provide friendly and helpful hotel staff makes all the difference
609,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,royal plaza a great choice hotel very good hotel not my first but always my choice of hotel when i holiday in singapore great superb location easy walking distance to many places and their mrt food choices you be spoil with many choices around the area hotel staff and facilities topnotch
610,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,top shelf service was magnificent location ideal right in the middle of everything beautiful and clean throughout the only very minor issue we had was not liking the pillows and having no options to swap them out will be staying here every time were in singapore
611,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,bad food good rooms n service rooms are of quality but the food didnt meet the expectations it lacked variety and quality also they closed the breakfast at around which i thought was early indian cuisine is not paid attention to and had i not been a pescatariani would have starved
612,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,nothing special stayed at deluxe room spacious room and bathroom no standing shower only bathtub weird design of the bathroom the bed is so nice and comfy however the bed frame was too big it makes me bump several times and hurt my feet so bad located at orchard road but from orchard mrt station you have to cross the road via underpass about mins walking free minibar orange juice apple juice coke jasmine tea isotonic have nespresso machine in the room
613,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,no issues at all enjoyed all parts in the stay at your hotel and did not have any complaints or issues at all room was spacious and clean staff were friendly managed to get a free upgrade of room due to expedia booking as well thank you royal plaza on scotts

617,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,pleasant and convenient old and reliable establishment recently renovated convenient location closed to orchard road shopping and eateries always friendly the lobby staff and reception are most welcomingcomplimentary drinks in room are appreciated but we only consume the mineral water as senior citizens we avoid the sugary drinks we also skipped the buffets at the hotel as we avoid heavy meals perhaps the hotel can package a different and lighter meal program for seniors so we cant give you an honest feedback on the food qualitybut have to say their advertisement for middle eastern food looks very enticing housekeeping staff were very prompt with our request for extra towels and a prayer mat and clean our room very well wifi needs some improvement as you need to find a proper place in
618,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,very good value for money stayed nights days with no issues at all great location and good value for the money spent there are great shopping location around the corner is very close to dempsey hill which is where all the high end restaurants are locatedgreat for anniversaries

629,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,great location but room need upgrading best location in the city right smack in orchard road walking distance to the shopping area however getting around the hotel can be confusing as the lobby is on th floor and has different entrances room is a bit outdated as it is an old hotel better to improve on the decor and furnishing bed comfort was all right staff were friendly and helpful however check in was too slow had to stand for half hour before i get to the counter
630,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not as good as before not as good as before removal of hot drink bar in the internet room deluxe twin room beds are changed to single instead of super single need to book deluxe twin plus to get super single beds average service for front counter staffs good service for carousel restaurant staffs good location
631,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great value price was the lowest for a star hotel in orchard location was superb food republic was just min walk in the next building staffs are courteous helpful and quick minibar and nespresso were free there was portable wifi device to use during day trips
632,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,dropped standards over the years we have stayed at this hotel for years on many occasions the standards have dropped recently prompting us to think about looking elsewhere for future trips to singapore the doorman other than sayed are not as attentive as they should be and on occasion are on their mobile telephones when guests are clearly requiring assistance also the quality of the minibar has dropped considerably and no longer caters for guests with low or no sugar drink requirements only supply full sugar drinks such as coke and orange juice
633,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,the location of the hotel is good the hotel location is close to the subway orchard station and very convenient to go shopping or getting light meals this hotel can be recommended to foreign visitors for both business and sight seeing
634,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,room ending in the hotel is very nice and location is great to get out and about for shopping and restaurants do not accept a room that ends in i was in and these rooms back to an alley and the noise level was significant and made for poor sleep while i know they cant be responsible for external issues its not a room i would pay snight for ever again
635,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good location comfy bed good location for exploring the city loved the free wifi you can take around with you really helped us make the most of our trip the downside for us was the window looked out onto a car park so we missed the night time lights
636,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great place to stay when in singapore will definitely stay at royal plaza on scotts the next time i visit great for business and family courteous staff and central location for shopping clean rooms and loved that the mini bar came free with the room so no more running for drinks at the convenience store

638,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,wonderful staycation pleasant stay as usual checkin and out were fast and efficient standard of buffet breakfast seemed to have slipped in terms of variety and quality room was supposed to be newly renovated but didnt feel like new nonetheless they were comfortable and clean overall highly recommended for the location and comfort
639,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,no smoking room or balcony so boring not much to get and since im smoker it a boring hotel i need to go down every time i want to smoke even during raining food are the same all days viewing only next building concrete block
640,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not as good as we hoped the hotel was newly renovated clean had large rooms for singapore and a good location for a reasonable price i would recommend for singles or couples although there are other good options too however they could not provide sleeping arrangements for our family despite emailing one month before asking a simple request of king bed in one room and singles in the connecting room it meant we had to share people in one bed and a single in the other they do not have the ability to provide extra bedding or split rooms it is only both king or both twin bedding they simply could have informed us of this before we got there and we could have made alternative arrangements instead they took our money and waited until we arrived to inform us of this issue
641,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great stay hotel is newly renovated which makes it way better than before more roomy and spacious the hotel is located very strategically very accessible and only a walking distance to everything you should also try their buffet they have a great line up of food
642,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,ideal location at central area its an ideal location shopping district and located at singapore city central area its convenient and nearby orchard mrt station it is easy to access anywhere in singapore would definitely revisit this hotel again

645,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,about the hotel the hotel is excellence in terms of location and cleanliness the breakfast is very good however i experienced a low internet connection and sometimes there were no internet connection when using wifi in the room

652,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,satisfying experience satisfying that is one word to describe my overall experience at royal plaza location in the middle of orchard area check in and check out ran fast room was clean and spacious definitely worthy to stay there and enjoy the beauty of singapore
653,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,hotel near orchard royal plaza on scoots have a great service they knew how to give their guest complimentary for those which they cant provide service i was satisfied with their do us the hotel is very strategiss and who love orchad you just find it when you step out from the hotel the service is good stard from check in until we check out thanks to royal plaza employee who have us a great treat to the guest
654,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice location great location and close to pretty much everything you need absolutely loved the pocket wifi as i didnt need a sim card only drawback was rooms dont have any views restaurant prices are also steep especially for a breakfast buffet
655,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,basic but great location i travel a great deal in southeast asía this was not my first time in singapore i booked this hotel at the last minute because my other usual hotels were booked couple things to share i was happy that i knew beforehand that the hotel did not serve any alcohol hotel has brunei heritage and that service was not to be expected i was there as a solo female traveler for days and not a single staff person ever greeted me upon arrival or departure the only exception was an older gentleman at the taxi stand who always tried to greet me the room was basic but tidy with all my needs nespresso machine was a great touch breakfast was filled with families every morning honestly it was the first time i ever felt a bit odd as a solo female business traveler location was
656,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,would stay there again fantastic hotel the staff could not look after you enough room was bigger than normal it was kept spotless the free mini bar was a god send our key stop working one evening so they gave us another room to use while it was being fixed what a service will return on my next trip the brekfast was a shock to the system what a choice the made while you wait minute omelette fantastic
657,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,good hotel its a good hotel for a business trip not more if you are visiting singapore for your honeymoon search for a another hotel as the rooms are small the location is perfect and close to everything its a good hotel not bad
658,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,two night stay in singapore we have been to singapore on numerous occasions but this was the first time to stay at the royal plaza on scotts the location is next to orchard road and all the top end luxury shops you might want the hotel was very good the room was clean and spacious and the breakfast in the dinning area was amongst the best for choice we have experienced it only has a small swimming pool but i guess most folk dont come to singapore for the pool we will certainly consider coming back to the royal plaza on scotts some time again
659,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great location i have stayed there previously and loved the location staff are friendly and helpful also like the fact that its a non smoking establishment my only comment would be that the rooms are on the small side and needed a refresh however my understanding is that they are currently renovating the rooms obviously our floor has yet to be completed would stay there again
660,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,bucket list f race i had the f singapore race on my to do list so when we decided to go we booked with a well known travel group imagine our jou when we checked into this great hotel the reception staff were welcoming and nothing seemed too much trouble great room on the th floor breakfast was a treat with a very large choice the location was really good with my significante other half delighted with the shopping i was more than happy with the bar accross the road as the rugby world cup was also being shown great place and would love to go again we will see as the to do list is quite long
661,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,the best for short stay stay here for nights with family location superb in the junction of orchard walking distance to all orchard malls and mrt staffs and services are excellent room nice and clean love the rainshower free minibar and pocket wifi halal breakfast are delicious but too bad everyday breakfast has same exact menu thats why the title best for short stay youll get bored with the breakfast menu if you stay more than nights
662,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not quite there nothing to really fault across most aspects from check in and out to meals rooms etc but think pricing too high in relation to other comparable hotels in singapore paying a top of orchard rd price no longer needed or deserved found hotel a bit lacking in soul swimming pool is awkwardly located but guess cannot easily be changed also directional signage poor
663,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,always my favourite my rd visit to this hotel after quite some time i noticed that the rooms have been renovated to a more modern ambience making them more bright and look more spacious i was given a free upgrade which was thoughtful of them they knew i was there for special occasion i did not request for an upgrade but still was given by the hotel thank you royal plaza what i love about this hotel is the location it is central close to malls eateries and mrt rooms restaurants and lobby are clean staff are helpful and very friendly just as excellent as i remembered when i first stay here years ago keep it up royal plaza i will definitely come back
664,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great location clean and friendly room was beautiful and clean free non alcoholic mini bar and nespresso machine nice pool and gym was fine for a hotel staff very friendly and helpful location is unbeatable i highly recommend this hotel
665,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great place to stay generally no problems other than the bathroom door which the suction tape had come off slightly everything else was great from food at carousel staff hospitality cleanliness etc overall a great place to stay
666,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent the location and service of the hotel are excellent cleanliness and food items served in breakfast are really international standard safety is superb the wifi system and courteous behavior of hotel staff are appreciable
667,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice but noicy guests the hotel is nice big and apparently received several awards they are on display in the lobby the room was good and clean the breakfast was abundant the negative point was that when other guests were talking in the corridors we could hear them loud snd clear in the room i woke up several times ware these party guests
668,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,unluckily room next to the lifts room next to the lifts so annoying as early in the morning the lifts machine created annoying sound you had to wake up early though you were expecting to keep sleeping suggestion dont sell rooms next to the lift or sell in a very cheap price
669,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,a pleasant stay checkin and checkout process was efficient staffs are courteous and helpful the service was good this is a busy hotel that catered mostly to families with kids our room is spacious and free minibar was just a selection of can drinks and small cup of juices free wifi breakfast was awesome the breakfast had a large selection of food and all is halal food excellent location we can find food around with several choices dutyfree shopping next to the hotel only a few steps away from orchard road close to the shopping malls mrt station the bus station is front of the hotel and very easy to catch a taxi we had a pleasant stay and value for money
670,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,comfortable accommodation and very good lounge access had a two night stay whilst on transit through singapore having stayed at the rpos earlier in i was confident that the premier king would be a comfortable room for a short stay as a couple during this visit we actioned the royal club lounge access which provides a generous food beverage offering on a daily basis the room is large and bright and comfortable with service staff very personable and attentive and the food wines of a good quality ive not had the breakfast at the ground floor level so cannot compare to the offering in the lounge but it was very good with good variety and teas coffees made to offer we enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere each day and evening and were very well taken care of the location of the hotel is very good for access to orchard
671,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,could do better this is the third time i have stayed here so they must be doing something right however there has been a few changes in the last two years the rooms have been refurbished the dark wooden furniture has been replaced with a lighter modern look but for anyone staying more than a week i am here for days there are no draws in the room other than the one under the kettle which is taken up with the tea making facilities and a tiny draw in the desk there are very few shelves but lots of hanging space looks modern and minimalist but not very practice the tv is great with english channels like hbo films although annoyingly the sound is out of sync the mini bar is complimentary but you can only have full sugar drinks diet coke is not included we asked but was told not
672,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good everythings good in here recomended for short or long trip easy to access easy to find really near to mrt station the employee very helpful id like to stay longer in here but maybe room with city view will make it more perfect
673,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great hotel for singapore break really enjoyed our club room experiences here surprised how few guests appeared to participate in the lounge excellent staff in all areas who were always smiling attentive and helpful very comfortable rooms excellent temperature control and when your only negative is the music in the carousel restaurant at breakfast almost a perfect stay
674,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,a great place to stay in singapore i stayed with friends at the royal plaza on scotts during the week of the singapore airlines formula one grand prix walking into the air conditioned lobby area i was welcomed with the sweet smelling aroma of orchids the welcome from the desk staff was like id been there before and the service from day one to day seven was exceptional i was greeted with a smile by all staff i encountered the bedroom was very spacious and the bed the largest i have ever slept on im m tall and its so nice to not have your feet handing off the edge of the bed even when lying across the width of the bed the breakfast was fit for a king with a variety of foods to suit at dietary requirements the next time i am in singapore i will have no hesitation in asking to stay at the

680,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,home always being a place that i felt like i never leave home this has been my first choice since my family love it here too also this hotel keep on improving not only in terms of services but also design and decorations
681,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great hotel great staff and central location we are a couple in our s and last year and this year we have stayed st royal plaza for threefour nights to break the journey home from europe perhaps because we were repeat guests we were upgraded to a nicer room without asking the hotel is very busy with lots of conferences and weddings etc which gave the lobby a real buzzy ambience and yet in contrast our room was absolutely quiet the room was spacious and wellappointed the aircon maintains the rooms temperature while you are out during the day all the staff reception concierge and daily cleaning were friendly and engaging the hotels location right next to shaw house on the corner of scotts and orchard means you are minutes walk to the orchard mrt not only that but underneath shaw house is food
682,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good choice i highly recommend this hotel to any one planning to travel singapore either for business or holiday this hotel has very convenient location and easy to reach by public transportation the staff are very kind and polite i stayed at th floor and could access to the vip lounge on the th floor its a quiet and comfortable place for business meeting or chatting with friends
683,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,loved this hotel would come again we travelled to singapore for the f grand prix and this hotel was part of the packageon arrival a deposit of singapore dollars was asked for in cash which was quite a portion of the money that we had with us which i have never been asked for elsewhere and found strangethe rooms were clean and tidy the beds firm and comfortable and the amenities provided were excellent the fridge with complementary soft drinks and water topped up every day was most welcome in the heatthe buffet breakfast provided a large choice to suit western tastes and also asian omelettes and eggs being provided on demand cereals fresh fruitsalads cooked meat and choices of cooked foodi found the hotel to be excellent and would fully recommend it
684,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice room in good location spent a great weekend here very good size clean and comfortable room hotel is in a great location the lobby area is stunning and as everywhere in singapore the staff were great i would have scored this a five but for the breakfast it was pretty chaotic and once you had given in your room number you were left to find a clean and empty table the buffet was quite large but still disappointing compared to many other singapore hotels
685,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,great location for travelling around singapore nice hotel well located for mrt and the staff here are really nice and friendly lovely people no bar though and we had to go over the road to other hotel hyatt and other bars over there which is a real drawback in our opinion there are rooms that have been upgraded but ours had not been so was a little tired but was very clean the bed however is very comfortable indeed we were in which is next to the lift and so was noisy into the night and early morning for people checking out early which was an annoyance
686,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,horrible stay i saw white worms on the pillow twice there is no ventilation facilities at bathroom after days stay i changed another roomthe ventilation fan doesnt workthe room air is not circulating very humid the receptionist vivian has very bad attitude
687,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,lovely rooms but pushy concierge staff rooms were lovely shower was exceptional and breakfast was excellent i have stayed at royal plaza times before but this time i noticed the concierge staff were very pushy wanting to take my bags on the third time i was asked and my bags just about pushes away for me i finally relented but then comments referring to tips were made hell go hungry is an actual quote i do not believe in tipping for things i can do myself and had previously refused
688,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,great service value and location premier club package was great only ate out once great central location to orchard road n trains would definitely recommend and stay again premier package may seem expensive but it includes breakfast unlimited afternoon tea plus unlimited drinks for hrs and canapies
689,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,amazing stay on business amazing stay on business trip booked by my company speedy check in and check out free pocket wifi with unlimited internet and good g coverage the only downside is the auto on of the tv when you insert the keycard as the initial volume of the tv is excessively loud even if you switched off the tv and reduce the volume before leaving the room
690,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,bathroom the bathroom need to be cleaner and spotless however the bedroom was good not all staff is doing the warm welcome like other hotel does they need to be warmer smiling and attentive to check how was our room itd give a nice touch overall you are not bad but not good either improve the service warm welcome and more attentive
691,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,convenient location strategic malls and eateries everywhere mrt starbucks a stone throw away pricey but youre paying for the brand and location newly renovated overall pleasant stay for a short trip especially for shoppers
692,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent experience no issues with staff and room but pocket wifi was not really user friendly and not easy to connect perhaps consider to use simpler type of pocket wifi for convenience of guests late check out time was a bit difficult to get based on the time you want
693,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,very good all considered very good location staff lobby buffet however it doesnt reach the excellence due to the fact the rooms are pretty humid as need to be updated and especially considering the very high cost per night
694,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,nice with a great location royal plaza on scotts has a great location in singapore right at the intersection of scotts rd and orchard rd this is the place to be if youre interested in shopping and being in the middle of things the hotel is quite nice the staff is friendly and efficient it isnt particularly memorable in any specific way for me but i would say it is a solid option when looking for a great location and nice hotel in singapore
695,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,my business trip a very good place to stay close to many shopping outlets i like the food very much they serve halal food with varieties of malay and western menu room is very clean all staff are very friendly and always serve with a smile

701,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,business as usual this is my second time staying at this hotel centrally located nearby ion orchard road the reception team is efficiently okay as you would expect from any star hotel room is clean though the twin beds are rather small the swimming pool is quite small but swimmable breakfast choices are plenty and good however its coffee machines need to be upgraded really overall i think this hotel is definitely suitable for business travelers
702,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,days in singapore with my family three nights in singapore with my family central and strategic location clean rooms nice hall and well stocked courtesy service not bad the swimming pool on the th floor even if a little small for a short relaxing break about this hotel where i have stayed all the times that i have been in singapore during the past years i kept the memory of orchids at the entrance spacious rooms with big bathroom and huge kingsize beds coming back lately i never found the orchids again the rooms and the bathroom are much less spacious and the beds smaller and uncomfortable in a room for people we slept very tightly in two queen size beds and spaces were much smaller compared to what i remembered staff at the reception desk was not that friendly and differently
703,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great location the location price and staff were all excellent i also enjoyed the pool area which was private and protected away from the crowds and busy streets the pocket wifi was great once the staff helped us get it up and running i would definitely stay here again
704,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,excellent hotel in perfect location very nice luxury hotel the only complain is that iin this kind of luxury class hotel the breakfast room and the breakfast itself could be easily improved could have different kind of breads more viarity of cheese and hams smoked salmon natural orange juices etc the asian food was ok though overall an excellent hotel
705,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,perfect hotel in singapore top location comfortable room with everything that you are going to need for your staying friendly and helpful staff and the restaurant carousel top of the top definitely try the seafood buffet

707,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,best hotel in singapore i stayed at the hotel before and the reason we keep coming back is that the staff and the food are excellentthe service is great and they go out of there way to accomadate youthe rooms have been refurbished but i find the cupboard space small and less draws

709,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,best hotel in singapore among the best hotel in singapore ive stayed with halal food clean room and friendly staff its takes royal plaza into my hotel list for singapore visit i will come again once i come to singapore thanks for your hospitality
710,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,nice staff crowded lobby not spacious unlike other or star hotels i stayed in this hotel for couple of nights during family vacation to singapore here is my experience unlike other star hotels there is no place other than your room to sit peacefully because while entering into the hotel there is restaurant on left hand side which is open to guests and outsiders i heard restaurant serves good food and probably thats why it was always crowded and noisy people sitting outside in lobby etc i have always seen star hotels have plenty of space but this one is like you better be in room hotel says mini bar is complementary until you stay and realize thats its probably only star hotels min bar that has no food item like chips chocolates or beers all you get is soft drink cans and small packs of juices so it was of no use
711,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,awesome staycation had a weekend staycation at royal plaza on scotts rooms were available when we tried to checkin at pm the checkin was smooth just that we got taken a back by mr stevens surpriseddoubtful reaction when we told him that we will be staying at two separate rooms i assume there are other guests that choose to stay on separate rooms as well anyways giving him the benefits of doubts that he was trying to make small talks the complimentary premier rooms were very nice and brandnew the beds and pillows were comfortable my family member got a complimentary slice of cake for her belated birthday the ensuite bathroom was spacious with good quality toiletries we opted for the express checkout online overall we really enjoyed our short experience in rp this hotel

713,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,good location with spacious room the hotel location is pretty good just across hyatt hotel in orchard room is spacious unfortunately they dont have extra bed not bath robes it is such a star hotel with limited services i guess
714,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,good location if you do not mind paying very close to the underground station and walking distance to some large shopping areas if that is your thing the room was spacious and clean the toilet was nice with a decent shower same sort of view as other when it comes to customer relations the staff at the check in desk are quite short and not super responsive to friendly chat maybe i talk too much
715,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,best value hotel is in a strategic location just across far east plaza easy access to all orchard have to offer i find all the staff that i encounter here is nice and engaging to guest which reflect a good hospitality spirit we got upgraded to a suite so our room is super spacious with a living room and workdesk separated from our bedroom the room is kinda old but provide anything we need for a good stay for the price and value they offered this hotel is a very good choice for traveller looking to explore orchard area

727,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,three days at royal plaza there is no lounge or proper place to meet or to have short meeting with business partners at royal plaza warmed welcome greeting from all staff for muslim it is very convenience since the hotel provide all necessary things for praying including the time table for sholat the hotel more like a family hotel and not suitable for business agenda but the location is good near orchard with many shops and department stores
728,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good memories i like every associate is kind and friendly and the location is really good but the first time i tagged my card key in the elevator it didnt work so i went up and down many times and after a while i saw a little boy do the same you should fix that point

735,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,disappointing stay and very unhelpful staffs aside from the location there is really nothing special about this hotel the staffs are so unhelpful to the point they simply say no to your requests such as storing snowskin mooncakes to the freezer and refused to help further we were also traveling with an infant and they said no to checkout extension and also did nothing to offer kids amenities
736,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,not professional with handling customer request complimentary slice of cake was said to be provided as mentioned in email but was disregarded upon checkin the system probably did not have a database in place to save special request by customers overall a very unpleasant experience as compared to the other hotels i have stayed even a star would do better than this
737,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great hotel in the heart of the city orchard street enjoyed the stay at the royal plaza on scotts singapore while i was there with my kids on a business cum leisure trip the hotel staff is very efficient and helpful especially the men standing at the gate and near the reception three cheers will definitely return back

742,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,toilet floor toilet floor too slippery the flooring should be rough surface instead of smooth the flooring should change there is no grab bar at the bathtub or showering room the breakfast is tasteless it should improve

760,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,right in the pulse of orchard great location and accessible to public transport and orchard road area great service and being a halal partner was a plus point being able to catch a bus to the mrt and being a few steps away from the heart of orchard shopping area was blissful

762,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,2,bad experience very bad experience wouldnt come again hotel didnt have any shaving kits to use bed is uncomfortable and the light system is poor the aircondition is poor that my kids clothes cant dry out over night
763,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,it used to be better i stayed here many years ago because it was a decent star hotel in a very convenient location it was better then but seems like the quality has suffered a bit the bed was comfortable decent bathroom with a strong rain shower and adequate amenities breakfast was a bit of letdown as they used to have better food the selection was good but tasted below average even the juices were not freshly squeezed and seemed watered down

767,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great location but the children of some guests were illbehaved the hotel bell staff and receptionists were very friendly helpful checking us in efficiently our room was clean comfortable though not luxurious but the price and its location are excellent so theres nothing to complain about many of the guests were families with young children and throughout our stay we could hear kids running around outside laughing or shouting to each other we even had a few knocks on our door either honest mistakes or sheer mischief the noise was therefore quite irritating still its not the hotels faulthowever this may not be the best hotel if you wanted some peace quiet

798,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,best experience the hotel near orchard road and mrt station the hotel provides free soft drink and water the staff is friendly and the room hotel is very clean i would recommend the hotel to my friends and most of my relatives
799,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,everything was good other than breakfast poor breakfast service as have to line up for breakfast for more than minutes attempt made to clarify with the breakfast front desk staff regarding estimated time take to be seated was being told off to line up in a rude manner i think this can be further improve
800,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,musty room rude staff ive stayed at the royal plaza twice before in recent years and enjoyed it we used to stay in the bigger corner room but its not offered anymore apparently so thinking i would have the same level of comfort and service i booked a night stay two weeks ago sadly the hotel has deteriorated the room was cramped the carpet smelt damp and the airconditioning was musty and sent us into sneezing fits overnight the bedhead was dusty as well despite this we would have continued to stay on except for an extremely rude and petty housekeeping manager who refused to provide us with an extra bottle of water at night our family of three had come back at night after checking in earlier and realised we had drunk up all our water i called housekeeping for bottles but the staff
801,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,pleasant stay the impression of luxury as well as comfort ambiance immediately felt when entering the hotel lobby checkin process was very fast vivi who helped us even upgrade our room to premier king room so our children were very happy because there was a bath tub affordable room rates which is not much different from our previous hotel triple room in lavender but the royal plaza feels much more comfortable hotel room is quite spacious for expensive city singapore my kids even play hide and seek in the closet bed is comfortable and wide enough for of us adultsyoyo staff are friendly and helpful unfortunately nothing special for the breakfast almost all dishes taste standard except for the croissant that is crunchy yet soft inside
802,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,good experience in singapore nice trip at singapore choice royal scott because near from our destination tripn from orchard road and have a good room when we looked at online book overall we had good service from we check in stay at room and until we check out thanks to all staff we loved our trip
803,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,july stay royal plaza overall i am happy with the service by the hotels staff at the receptionist and the man who handles luggage they are all friendly very professional manner and also fast check out procedure the cleanliness of the hotel room is good and well arranged
804,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,honest review of rp there isnt a distinct q at the front desk so we randomly joined a line the check in was very slow and we waited for minutes check in was very troublesome we were asked to fill up details which are already known to the hotel maybe u guys can just asked for documents and verify the details the front desk staff named dragon speaks at a rate with an accent which is really difficult to catch and understand we checked in and was a little disappointed we requested for a high floor and knowing its our anniversary the hotel did nothing gym was good the toilet near the gym could have more room for shower housekeeper is friendly and would greet us when they see us inroom dining staff could do better there is leftover food outside the hotel room opposite
805,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,family trip to singapore hotel as brilliant staff friendly and welcoming room clean and free pocket wifi and soft drink mini bar we felt the hotel restaurant was very expensive and offered buffet only options sometimes we just wanted a light meal after having a large lunch whilst out this wasnt available so had to go out to eat
806,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,excellent location lovely ambiance the location is very strategic shops are just a walk away shaw centre and dfs are just next door the refurbishment and redecoration they do is very nice the ambiance was very welcoming the staff was also friendly and helpful
807,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,great place to stay highly recommend this place for it is modern clean and great food staff are helpful as well and nice it was close to some shops and we able to get a taxi to get us to some overall i enjoyed my stay
808,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,overall a good experience a friend and i had some things we wanted to do over the weekend and royal scotts was perfectly placed for us its close proximity to a lot of the places we needed to go to and the convenient breakfast buffet allowed us to chill and have a late checkout
809,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,1,arrogant receptionist made our trip became very unhappy training should be done many many times for the receptionist for how to talk and communicate with guestson july around pm the female receptionist forced me to show not only passport but another id though japanese has no other id written in english the attitude is just like police woman i had shown a copy of booking thru an internet travel agency on which my name was written in english but my wife and sons names were written in japanese i just followed the instruction of internet for booking you should have hired japanese reading receptionist if need to do so if her attitude is ok we were not got upset very very arrogant and impolite crazy girl on july pm this arrogant girl was in service we asked to lend us two umbrellas because we are three she
810,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,pleasant stay after more than five years from my last stay i love the hotel rooms even more i love how the management working hard to keep and increase the rooms quality disappointment came from the breakfast the buffet at carousel is one of the reason i rebook this hotel food quality has decreased compare to how i remembered it many buffet ago my omelette was half burnt while the chef busy talking and joking with his peers food spread taste and presentation was ok from the outstanding grade years ago i am waiting to be impressed once again
811,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not the same second time around i wont stay again as we had a v few negative things happen room was extremely smaller than i expected for the cost also our window was facing a brick wall mini bar wasnt always restocked so my husband had to walk to for cold drinks even though we called reception and they said they would sort it which they didnt and one day coming back to the room we had no electricity so no air con etc on the whole we love singapore and have been there five times but wont be staying in royal plaza in the future sorry
812,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,4,located in the city center nearby shopping center royal plaza has quiet room and privacy they are very clean room and good house keeping they are friendly staffs at the lobby and also in the restaurant i am happy staying at royal plaza on scotts hopefully i can stay there during my next visiting singapore
813,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,overall is good helpfull staf checkin housekeeping the room is big event the room only for person the location near to orchard road the amenities is complete clean room im very enjoyed it only the price need more discount promotion
814,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,singapore despite a short stay everything went perfectly from smiling doormen to airport drop off car service breakfast variety free minibar really an excellent initiative great experience and i will definitely stay again in this hotel
815,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,satisfied we have easily checked in the hotel and check out we have requested an hour late check out and they have granted the rate per room rend is reasonable it is in a place near to many shopping mall and cinaplex
816,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,3,not as good as expected owned by sultan of brunei we booked here after checking prices on and around orchard road and deciding that the royal plaza seemed reasonable value we are a family of and were able to book at delux room with beds so the kids could share we found out in the taxi that the hotel was owned by the sultan of brunei given the recent changes to some laws there this might impact peoples decisions the positives great location just next to orchard mrt via ion mall friendly staff who were helpful when things didnt go according to plan the negatives the pillows were too large for sleeping and too hard and no alternatives were available pocket wifi wasnt in room as advertised had to be requested and when received wasnt charged so couldnt be used room wasnt ready hours after check in time we were
817,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,even better four years later i had the pleasure of meeting such kind staff members on my last stay four years ago and returned to find its even better now that rooms have been further upgraded as with any hotel the physical facilities are far less important than the staff treatment at this hotel both excel yes the gym is small and the hugely positive staff attitudes more than make up for it i was especially impressed with the rapid and courteous checkin procedures which always starts a stay in a positive way
818,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,nice hotel great staff good location kinda old style but still ok restaurant staff not so friendly breakfast menu not really have varieties gym too small and equipment is not so complete pool also to small and kinda forced with the deep so kids dont really like it
819,Royal Plaza on Scotts Singapore,5,upgrade of rooms very impressive yet another stay at this wonderful hotel we dealt directly with tina kassim it was a delight we have been using royal plaza for a number of years now dealing with tina we were upgraded to the club premier room with all the privileges of the club lounge i was fortunate enough to meet tina for senior management at royal plaza she is not only very professional as a company you are very fortunate to have a staff member of tinas caliber we found very noticeable the improvements to the rooms in general an improvement on something that is always very well maintained and staff take a real pride in there work highly recommend royal plaza its position and amenities are second to none michael sutcliffe
820,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,superb very nice hotel and it is very near to bugis street swimming pool is amazing rooms are small but nice and cozy anyways we have to come to singapore to visit not to stay in a room very nice environment around we really enjoyed our short stay there

822,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,free parking this is another hotel with free parking room is decent but value for as its slightly above budget hotel standard the front reception staff displayed great hospitality service to me and offered me a free upgrade thank you
823,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,very nice staff hotel is very well located close to the subway swimming pool is nice the room was a little bit small for a family but you are not going to singapur to stay in the room very nice staff thanks to alriana sari melissa and sabrina
824,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,hotel hotel room space is very smallthe breakfast is not good specially for indian the breakfast room is very much small at it is overcrowdedthe location is good as nearby metro station is rochar which is walking distancethere are near by indian hotels specially shish mahal indian restaurant which is very goodthe bed linen is not change if withour instruction the behavior of reception stall is very rude they think that tourist coming to singapore is obliging to them no respect for them
825,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,parc sovereign albert street the parc sovereign hotel albert street singapore is a four star hotel but has nothing worth a four star it is a best place to stay if you want to stay near little indian or mustafa main market for purchasing the hotel rooms and the bathrooms are very small the swimming pool and the gym is not worth mentioning as it is more of a show than anything else the breakfast spread definitely needs improvement the reception staff are really courteous smiling and polite writing a email to the hotel elicits a response at a snails pace view from the hotel room is not at all pleasingly
826,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice hotel for short term stay in bugis checked in at pm fast and effortless went to deluxe room nice and clean with wide table it is important to have wide table if you want to put laptop ipad and phone and there are enough place within this room for you to charge phone ipad and laptop as well as personal modem went to swimming pool and gym area swimming pool is okay but gym not much equipment there are many eateries nearby and you can go to shopping malls and then come back to hotel this hotel is upsized version of frangrance hotel ruby at gelyang red light district because both deluxe rooms are similar i like this deluxe room because it is very suitable for me went to sage restaurant for breakfast just average not like those in classy star hotels
827,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,good hotel good hotel near by little india and many indian restaurants hotel has swimming pool and small gym facility many options for shopping with in minutes walking in singapore all hotel room size are small
828,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel at a good location very good hotel at a convenient location rooms are good but a bit small area is very quite and in a good location swimming pool is clean and quite big and there is also a fitness centre buffet breakfast is quite good but needs a bit improvement there is also a eleven at the hotel mustafa center is min walk and bugis street market is min walk away
829,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,rooms are very tiny but staff breakfast is good enough i had booked a family roomadults kids as shown on all the hotel bookings sites but wehn u checkin the room it was tooo tiny clumpsy the bathroom was another blunder they had a shower cubile of inches x inchescan u imagine to take bath in such a matchbox kinda place there was hardly any place in the room the bathroom to move around the room which have mentioned as family room is not even enough for adults i had also requested them to upgrade me to a bigger room with an extra payment but the reply was thats the biggest room they have imagine the size of their smaller rooms the breakfast was good even the staff was good helpful
830,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,holiday in singapore this hotel was arranged by the travel agent when we decided to have our holiday in singapore we stayed for three nights the hotel is close to highway and due to delay in flight we reached there very late the staff was somewhat arrogant and response to queries were not satisfactory the hotel is very close to little india and many indian restaurants were available within walking distance and this was liked by all overall it was an average stay
831,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great hotel near little india this hotel is very much suitable for indian tourists and business travelers during my visit i could see lot of indian and chinese tourists staying in this hotel the breakfast spread is decent and they also keep an indian selection the room size is as per singapore standards so not too small and not big too i recommend staying in this hotel
832,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,singapore holiday we were booked at this hotel by our tour operator as it was closer and walkable distance to indian restaurants and little india hotel is nice but rooms are little smaller in size their restaurant where breakfast is served is also low on space and gets cramped during breakfast time most of the indian restaurants are walkable distance service was good overall quite decent stay

835,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,terrible experience my company booked me in this hotel just because singapore was very busy this week and all better hotels are fully booked we are a group of and was booked for our first night here thank god we are moving to a different hotel for our nd night till our th night didnt really mind that the rooms were tiny and basic but the problem we encountered is the most important thing in a hotel airconditioning the absence of it we arrived in singapore and checked in around half past midnight when we went up to our different rooms in the th floor the airconditioning is busted in all our rooms i called the reception and informed them of the problem they had to call maintenance to fix the problem took an hour to get the ac up and running so i was back in my room around at
836,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent hotel is situated at the heart of the city where your tour will start and easy approachable hotel is beautiful excellent and exciting and recharge your energy after coming from site visits restaurant is also very good and contains variety of dishes
837,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,not for honeymooners we went to singapore few days for our honeymoon and we stayed for nights in this hotel we send an email before than go to tell them that we were in our honeymoon and if they can give us any free upgrade we totally understand that you cannot get free upgrade in all the hotels but in our honeymoon we stayed in different hotels and this was the only one where did not offer nothing special to us as you know it was special occasion in some hotel give us some chocolates other some flowers decoration other free upgrade something nice to make us feels welcome the email was replied for edmund who tell us that kindly be advise that our hotel does not provide any complimentary upgrade form honeymooners sorry for any inconvenience caused so advice if you are in your
838,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,one of the best hotel in singapore one of our favorite hotels in singapore the rooms are superb with all the amenities the hotel is located at the heart of singapore from where you have easy access to any place around the train station is just a min walk the staffs are extremely friendly with excellent hospitality the restaurant is wonderful and one should try their complimentary breakfast we spent evenings here which was a great experience
839,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent service and super hosts front desk and team are so welcoming they gave me a free upgrade instantly upon request had nice conversation with the folks and they made my day singapore has small hotels per law so please double check before booking your room i definitely recommend this place appreciate sri sabrina ammar and kaffil for their help
840,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,cozy place the location of this hotel is an advantage for a tourist the reception is quite good hassle free and fast checkin and check out rooms are a bit small but contains all the basic amenities as a tourist we tend to spend less time in the room and more on the streets breakfast spread is decent free wifi service available to all guests its in the vicinity of every major city attraction
841,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,the hotel does not cater for western tourists ill start with saying the location of the hotel is good m from rochor mrt and little india station or its a mins walk from raffles hotel area downtown the hotel has a very inviting lobby as well and quite nice pool area that was never overcrowded during our stay this is where the positives end negatives the rooms are so tiny that we could not open our suitcases shower is tiny and we are slim people the view from our window was horrible see photo attached breakfast offered some curry rice lentil soup fries and over cooked scrambled eggs the floor of the restaurant was absolute mess but thats probably not hotels fault but the guests that are staying there are behave like unsocial pigs the walls in the room are so thin that we could hear
842,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,not happy the rooms were ridiculously small for a supreme double bed it was difficult to breathe with people staying in such a closed space no room to keep the luggage and bathrooms were too small
843,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,budget hotel i spent a week here with my family this is a decent hotel centrally located and easily accessible from rochor and little india mrt this place has a small restaurant at the ground floor rooms are pretty small and so is the bathroom worth a stay for the price i paid
844,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,singapore tour the hotel is nice not that big but the staffs were all accomodating and approachable specially their filipino managerthe location was good enough to go around some particular places such as bugis and little india
845,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,convenient and functional we stayed three nights at this hotel a return visit to a stay we had here about years ago the hotel is located right next door to the rochor mrt so is very convenient for travelling around the city i booked direct with the hotel as they offered the best rate check in is efficient rooms are quite small and the bathroom is very small lots of reviewers have pointed this out there is no room for luggage so its fine if you travel lite the room is very clean and well serviced each day we had two rooms for our family and did find it weird that one room had more tv channels than the other the pool is great although it is very shallow about m deep the entire length check out is smooth and efficient we left our bags for the day after checking out
846,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,do not bother planning to use the facilities if you are a business traveler room size is quite adequate for singapore room is clean and comfortable but not at all soundproof from adjoining rooms in the most ludicrous facility policy i have heard the gym and pool can be used am pm only yet somehow there were tourists in the pool behind a locked door at nearly pm i booked the hotel specifically because it had a fitness center the hours would only accommodate someone traveling for leisure wont be making that mistake again additionally the hotel is far too catering to large tour groups
847,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,holiday stayed for nightswell located mins walk to little india mins to bugis streetlimited choice for breakfastdo not expect continental breakfasts since they decide as per guests nationalitygot chinese indian breakfasts during my staycould eat only toasts and had teabreakfast area is too small and can accommodate only personsrooms are nice and cleanbed comfortablebut very helpful staffthey are always willing to help and advise
848,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,covenient comfortable the location is central very close to rochor mrt and little india lots of eateries around and there is a store in the hotel complex however rooms is very small no space to walk after luggage is stacked
849,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,disgusting where to begin it is extremely overpriced for the room size you get my mother and me are sharing a queen bed and thought it was extremely hard and it turned out that we were sleep on top of two mattress bases the shower is barely big enough to turn around in we asked for clean sheets and were suspicious they never changed them so we marked them and asked for the sheets to be changed again and we checked and found the same sheets had been reused the stains on the bedding is disgusting and they didnt take the rubbish away the staff are okay but the cleaning crew need a kick up the ass we definitely not recommend to stay here
850,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent very nice hotelwith proper serviceindian food very nicely served with proper quality and tasteroom service very nicelocation is the best because it is near to little india and boogis streetnear the metro station also
851,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good stay i have stayed for nights in this hotel that is located not far from the downtow of singapore the room is clean big enough and comfortable for peoples the breakfast is included and the meals are acceptable
852,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,nice location clean rooms decent breakfast and nice little swimming pool from the time checkin i could sense that things are going to be great the ambience around the hotel is quiet it is centrally located and very close to little india there are also mrt stations at walkable distance the rooms were very clean housekeeping was great there was a min refrigerator inside a kettle for coffee team making was very handy access cards to room and floors makes us very secure the swimming pool in the th floor was small but it is good enough to relax after hot day outside the breakfast had decent variety overall the stay was enjoyable and the staff were very friendly
853,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great service i admire the service the staff has given us during our day stay a lot of pinoy staff which is a plus because we get to talk to them and ask about the nearest places around our hotel the hotel is near from places that tourists will love to visit theres a hawker place near from it and a convenience store that is just right down it near from the train or metro transportation is not hard the only thing that i believe we didnt enjoy is the breakfast buffet as it caters mostly indians and the food they serve is not something everyone is familiar but a hainanese place and other restaurants can be a great option instead
854,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,best place to stay we had great time at parc hotel is centrally located bugis little india mustafa is near by mrt station is nearby hotel is clean and staff is very supportive and always smiling rooms were clean our room had gallery which was quite spacious breakfast has little spread in indian food but fulfilling if you like american breakfast
855,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,nice hotel very nice hotel staff are all very welcoming and friendly always with a smile upgraded us to a poolside room cleaner come everyday also friendly and chatty pool looks nice area could do with a few sun beds to relax out on all areas clean and shiny
856,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,comfortable stay located a little away from little india next to rochor mrt stationvery comfortable stayalthough room was small for an indian touristbut thoughtfully designedstaff is very friendlyindian veg food is availablea memorable stay
857,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,very small room average breakfast buffet room size is very small tough to accommodate adults and kid on the bed buffet breakfast is very average needs to be more clean and the buffet area is too small for the number of guests number of channels are very minimal location of the hotel is good
858,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,budget hotel more or less a place to sleep with no many things to offer i have to be honest havent spent enough time to explore but from the first view and offered dinner minimalistic rooms are clean and as the position of the hotel is just in the middle of town do not expect some attractive views
859,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,sg experince upon arrival midnight mr sadiq and mr darren was so helpful he even upgraded us to a higher room category including our room request we requested an adjacent room for easy accessibility our room was replenished and cleaned daily we had also a nice view in our room th floor the location was very convenient very near to shopping complex and bugis street for souvenirs daily buffet breakfast was good they were so accommodating and professional maybe they can improve on food choices and varieties overall it was very good
860,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great value this is the second time i have come to this hotel staff are warm and friendly and extremely accommodating rooms are clean and tidy but in the occasion when things unexpectedly occur like the air conditioning failing they were quick to respond and rectify love the pool and location is amazing metres from the mrt close to all shops markets boutique outlets hawker centres and bugis cant go wrong ill be back for sure special thanks to ian lee and their team in reception they know how to treat their guests well done from a frequent traveller phil
861,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,clean and comfy stay in singapore i stayed at parc sovereign hotel albert st in singapore for one night although i booked for two i did that to ensure i have a room until i leave to the airport although the hotel rooms are smaller which is common in singapore the service of the staff and available facilities for the price were amazing i arrived from colombo on a late night flight and landed in singapore around am i reached the hotel by am and by am i was given a room without any extra charges the room had all amenities mentioned at the time of booking although the view from the room wasnt that great i was not bothered as i was out most of the time housekeeping was done daily water bottles tea coffee packets toothpaste tooth brushes etc are refilled on a daily basisi
862,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,budget and good hotel hotel is good with good reception staff indian and mexican restaurants and availability just very near to the hotel walkin distance from bugis market and mustafa centre rooms size is small but yes can accommodate guests easily i am a travel agent by profession and will recommend this hotel to budget traveller follow me on insta travel with nishant
863,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,very comfortable hotel with excellent staff great location comforttable but rooms are a little small well located with metro and shops all within walking distance breakfast lacked variety excellent front office staff who were very friendly and helpfulwould definitely go back
864,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good location but very small rooms size i went there with family hotel overall was good location is very good near lim sim square but room size is very small and break fast was just ok hotel manager took my feedback regarding everything and tried his bit to improve the breakfast so it forced me to give stars as they want to give services to customers and take care of feedbacks cheers
865,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,worst breakfast ever not completed hrs also and hd to write this i have been to many hotels but this place has worst breakfast thailand hotel had better breakfast and rooms than this hotel has hence it has no comparison with hotels in europe usa australia etc do not opt for it
866,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,awesome hotel big thanks to the staff to let us check in earlyto the point things we got a mobile phone which was complimentary with room which was very helpful during our stay very near rochor mrt station and bugis shopping district and little india room sizes are small but that is the case with many hotels in singapore beds are very comfortable room service was excellent staff was very helpful the pool was lovely and clean and refreshing and gym was fine we were little scared as we read a review that hotel walls are paper thin but we did not faced that quite location not noisy eleven store just beside the hotel for any day to day stuff there is another shop opposite hotel too housekeeping staff cleaned our room every day during our nights stay there daily two
867,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,awesome place in the heart of singapore very close to bugis little india with og shopping center lots of eating places in and around with broadway rochor hawker center and a food court at bugis junction all major to brands are available i would recommend stores near bugis street one is japan house other is a dollar store where you really get chocolates utility items cheap
868,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great place to stay the staff are very cooperative very close to little india the guests staying here are mostly indians breakfast has good options including indian preparations even jain food is available in breakfast which surprised me
869,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,good hotel good hotel responsive housekeeping courteous staff great breakfast strategic location moderate restaurants in vicinity for vegetarians room was bit small and so was bathroom but amenities are good
870,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,nice but the hallway could get noisy at night the hotel is quite all right very convenient and close to everything if you enjoy indian food little india is right around the corner the bed was big and comfortable for the room type i was in the only complaint i have is when other customers come back to the hotel at night i could hear every single thing they do or say in the hallway the door isnt air proofed so if you have neighbors who likes to speak loudly and constantly open and closes doors
871,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,near to most attractions and mrtlrt compact rooms excellent breakfast provided extremely friendly staff quiet area cum location nearest to little india and mrtlrt excellent for couples walkable from little india bugis street mustafa centre nearest mrt is rochor
872,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good service first of all the hotel rooms are small n so is the bathroombut that shouldnt sway away u from selecting this hotelevrythn else is goodthe room service requests fr anythn needed guidance about mrt for going from one to anotherevrythn went on smoothlyespecially the guys fakhruddin and syakir took care that whatever we asked for was donethanku guys and thanku hotel sovereign
873,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,pleasant stay this is my first time in singaporei found the room to be a little small not sure if that is how most of the hotel rooms in singapore really arehotel is reasonably pricedthe buffet breakfast was just ok and nothing to boast about rooms are clean ac was fine good room service and the staff at reception were friendly and politelocation is close to little india and mustafaif you are new to singapore and are looking for a decent indian restaurant near the hoteldo try the woodlands and madurai idli shop and you wont be disappointed if you are looking for luxury this is not the place to beexpect a decent star experience and you would be satisfied the pool on th floor is good too
874,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,location good but bad rooms stayed here for one night on my way back to india and though the location is in close promixity to bugis and little india for all shopping and foodies the hotel room is very small and can fit only pax and no place for luggage the room on the fourth floor opens to the swimming pool and if you with kids you need to be extra vigilant as there is no one near the pool the breakfast is avoidable and not much overall a okay experience if you want to spend the day out and sleep night
875,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,great location terrible wifi stayed here for nights the location is great close to bugis and orchard road the hotel rooms are large and comfortable though the shower is pretty small its pretty tight when taking a shower if youre on the large side youll be bumping into the cold wall or have the shower curtain sticking to you wifi is important to me to stay in touch with whats going on back home the wifi at the parc sovereign was not that good at all i often choose my hotels if reviews say wifi is good so be warned to the management it would be easy to update your wifi for your guests
876,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,cool hotel to stay inn rooms are clean prompt services excellent mattresses and washrooms pool was awesome and sitting area near the pool could be a great place to click photos indian and english breakfasts and walking distance from little india in case you are planning to book a cab for that a bit further would take you mustafa market
877,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,nice rooms terrible wifi rock hard bed nice rooms nice staff terrible wifi and terrible bed are important things for me in a hotel room the wifi was a nightmare kept disconnecting constantly every couple of minutes i ended up using my data roaming instead bed was rock hard terrible
878,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,i stayed on a business trip for days staff was is very good and helpful rooms and bath rooms were bit too small for me though and breakfast was just sd and it was not bad the front gentleman mr samsudin is a very kind person and helped us alot
879,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,really good hotel this is a really good hotel to stay with family members friendly staff and very helpful rooms are clean nice restaurant too boogie street just working distance and there are plenty of food stalls nearby too

882,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice hotel on the edge of little india i have stayed here a few times and find it to be one of the better budget hotels in this area the rooms are clean and a little bit more spacious than the big chains around singapore the pool is great for cooling down on a hot day staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms have everything you need the price is worth the extra to dollars compared to the big chains min walk to rochor mrt and close to lots of shopping options
883,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,my experience in parc sovereign hotel i enjoyed my stay at parc sovereign hotel days it is super clean great service and awesome breakfast the staff are very polite and helpful given a chance to visit singapore i would certainly pick this hotel again surely i have no regrets staying in this hotel wohooo try it travellers highly recommended
884,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,what to expect ok so we stayed for n room is okay quite small but manageable our room has a balcony we had their queen bed which is big enough for adt small child bathroom is small though but its okay bec first of all we are not after the bathroom for their breakfast more on indian foods so we had just the vegetable fried riceegg and sausage on first day next day we had their potato wedges and ham they do also have bread and cereals and fruits reading other reviews some really complain with the breakfast for us we were okay with the foods we had been eating anyway breakfast is not complimentary so you can choose not to add upon booking and you can order to their restaurant if you want to have breakfast or you can go buy at eleven attached to the hotel all
885,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,awesome place in the heart of singapore this hotel is busy quite a few indian tourists ideal hotel between bugis little india the hotel staff is awesome specially the concierge mr shamsuddin very helpful ample of options for vegetarians non veg halal food

890,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,stop over hotel has small clean rooms staff are friendly found other people from varying nationalities rude letting their doors slam continually with no consideration for anyone elsethe doors can be held partially open with the locking mechanism which makes an absolute racket when let go most likely wont stay here again because it was so annoying
891,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,its starr in name and star in service the service to my expectation was little average and room size are also small ac takes half an hour to cool the room which is a by room quality of daily cleaning item are also not so good and seems like cheap brand overall if it is a star hotel then its not up to the mark staying here feels like i am back in years time sorry no hard feelings but its an honest view of mine
892,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,very convenient location and excellent service the hotel lobby is very nice and elegant upon arrivalthe staff was very friendly and accommodatingthey called taxis and told us about things we shouldnt missthey allowed us to stay in lobby and have a swim in the pool till it was time to leave for the airport even though we checked out the location is convenient as its very close to rochor mrtlittle indianand burlington squarebut the room is quite small with a little coffee area and wardrobeno space for large baggageits good for a couple with no kids or for peoplei had to share my room with my sisters and its very kinda crampedalso it can get kinda noisy if the guests are loud also you could buy attraction tickets for them and its less expensive than buying it from the place itself
893,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great location for vegetarian the hotel looked great upon arrival very nice elegant lobby big thanks to the staff was kind enough to let me check in early the superior room is quite small it will just be comfortable enough for a single person or small couple with no kid the closet has no space for clothes only hangers and theres a safe in the closet theres no room for big luggage theres a little coffee area which youll get complimentary water tea and coffee daily the room has a wall window that opposite to an apartment complex so if you like privacy this window is no use the bathroom is small hot water takes a while to get really hot there are small tiny bugs around the roombathroom i think they are harmless they didnt bother me but i thought i should mention it it can
894,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,location location no dramas at all for security reason they took our passport details which i didnt mind reception are nice and welcoming room is reasonably clean everything we need is there ill recommend it to my friends in australia and philippines
895,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,average experience hi we stayed for days room interior is pathetic ac not working for around hours wifi not good staff are quite good breakfast well suited for indians i think one can get better hotel in this rangw
896,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,horrible support small room poor house keeping not worth at all for family horrible reception service most noise from the lobby area very small room passage between bed wall small bathing area not ready to hear the guest voice even when ready to pay the addl charges to upgrade the room
897,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,good location good hotel good location near to bugis street bugis junction and also og dept store next to room is quite small but everything is good clean friendly and helpful staff i definitely will stay there in next visit to singapore
898,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,hotel stay we were visiting singapore on our anniversary the hotel is located at a very convenient location as it has a good connectivity for public transport options like metro and bus a great thanks to mr jay for helping us get an early check in as our flight from india was an early morning one he was very helpful and kind to guide us for many things like recommendations for places to see and markets to visit also he took out to explain us in detail how metro lines would help us in traveling from a to b about the hotel it was nice stay with good room service although the room sizes are small but that is the case with many hotels however for a budget trip it is the best considering the prime location
899,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent stay at singapore parc sovereign hotel stay is just too good its situated close to little india and indians can close their eyes and book in here at singapore albert street great complimentary breakfast specially pongal was amazing special thanks to mr samsudinarcejay a gentleman who helped us during the checkin and checkout and addressing concerns if there was any wrt to the stay great experience visiting singapore and going in the near future i would book in here for sure
900,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,third time to stay and still excellent it is my third times to stay for the last year it seemed every months i stay this hotel when visiting singapore still excellent for the room and the best is about location that close to rochor mrt bugis is very close on walking distance and sim lim food court m from hotel will make you confuse because a lot lot of food to choose try and prove by yourself
901,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,comfortable enough basic nice pool this is my first time in singapore so ive not much to compare it to i did move from a hostel to here for nights i only stay in hostels so i meet other travellers and had a backpack i feel like i could have been treated a little different given i had a backpack basic room small bathroom tea and coffee available i was on level facing other buildings the pool was lovely and clean and refreshing and gym was fine i was also in a room next to other families travelling together so the kids were running between rooms screaming and slamming doors late at night it was actually quieter in the hostel but thats just the luck of the draw close to train little india sim lim square personally i would try another place when i come back
902,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice hotel for couples big room with wooden floor very nice decoration the bathroom was beautiful with colonial theme bed was very comfy lack of panoramic views pool can be seen from the breakfast area and cafe which is not so private location in the heart of sanur close to maya ubud beach front cafe
903,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,may not be the best but great enough ya the room was small and the bathroom smaller but if u r a real adventurer u got no problem with this the beds r comfortable and room quiet for night sleep the hotel location great easy accessing to all direction u want to start u day the value of stay in fare enough the personal and servant r so friendly and polite mrjaw and msseir the receptionists thank u both for your kindness
904,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,not the best hotel i ha e stayed in even though it was only a two night stay it wasnt the most comfortable one the hotel room is extreamly small barely enough room to keep an open luggage the bathroom is even smaller the bed had some hair on the linen and the room had ants breakfast area is small and was often crowded the only good thing is the location of the hotel a minut walk from the gardens by the bay
905,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,superb place to stay i was here with my family for nights hotel staff were friendly breakfast options were good overall service was good rooms are small but that can be ignored as we were most of the time out for sightseeing i got a very good deal online for this hotel walking distance to little india and city center
906,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,one of the best hospitality services by samsudin khafiil and his team last to last year in december me and my wife along with my newly married couple booked a hotel in singapore and really we had a great experience the service here is excellent the staff is so friendly and they ensure everything is to our liking i love that breakfast is included with the booking i selected the rooms are little small but extremely comfortable along with the free calling cell phones i especially loved the room along with the gym facility which they gave us near the swimming pool special thanks to mr samsuddin the manager of the hotel and his team keep up the good work guys
907,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,highly recommendedbest location we had a stay from to at this hotel very nice hotel clean very helpful and gentle staff especially mr jay at the reception does not have its own restaurant but the hotel at the adjoining provides breakfast the handy phone with data free local international calls was a great help full marks to the hotel staff for great hospitality out of for the hotel and thank you for the wonderful experience
908,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,great place to stay reasonably priced more a star than star as they claim no restaurant but adjoining fast food joint serves buffet breakfast rooms are clean but small almost cramped efficient room service and polite house keeping staff helpful and friendly front desk convenient location close to at least shopping centres and restaurants including little india and the metro quiet neighbourhood stay here if u are not looking for a or star
909,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,highly recommended quality assurance its a good hotel with quality in all ways reception n all other staff very helpful while checking they gave us the room an hr earlier as we were tired of long night flight location is best very near to bugis street n little india the breakfast is also awesome i loved having variety of food every morning for all days stay had a enjoyable sat in parc soverin hotel
910,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,hie this is jimilkumar i stayed for nights and this was wonderful experience special mention of sairi at reception who help us to guide the city people at hotel are goodjust one request please keep vegetarian counter far from non vegetarian example no egg itiem beside idliidli and vada should be together far from non veg during breakfast increase food itiems in vegetarian as per location for indians should prefer this hotel
911,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,nice stay i am a singaporean and the rooom is acceptable maybe coz i dont have a luggage but space wise what do you expect in singapore unless you want to go to a star hotel and pay for an extreme price seen the reviews and some of it arent true you pay for a certain price you get this i book this hotel at an affordable price as i only use the room for sleep purposes i wont make a fit if i dont get a free upgrade like hello in life nothing is free location wise and service wise is wonderful staffs are really helpful they greeted us happily before i reached the counter i feel welcomed the hotel stay always depends on who handled you at the counter well that explains why im happy to review this all thanks to the staff i cant remember the name but thank you parc sovereign
912,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,dreadful hotel we were booked in to this hotel by our travel agent i wish i had read the review before going there i would not have chosen this hotel at all must be the worst i have stayed in the room on the top floor was tiny the bathroom had a really bad smell every time water went down the drain we had no room for our luggage bed was hard air con was noisy the breakfast was inedible the choice was rice bits of fish chips vegetables rubber scrambled egg and dhal watered down juice melon bread cheap jam and a jar of butter if you were lucky to get any tea and coffee the hotel had a cheek charging for inferior food we thought reception had made a mistake as we were booked into a superior room on checking we discovered that was a superior room i
913,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,nice stay very good hotel with warm friendly and honest employees small room but clean relaxing place to stay hotel is near bugis market and mustafa ctr if youre a shopaholic for cheap but original products and only meters away from mrt and bus station and affordable authentic singaporean dishes are just around the corner breakfast every morning not plated but buffet style with several selections are delicious and healthy highly recommended if your budget is in the middle
914,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,small rooms old look out nothing special the rooms were small and the look was depressing needs heavy maintenance like coloring new furniture etc my son stayed there for days and this is his remark the advantage is that its near mustafa and other indian hotels
915,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,mr its nothing like what was advertise need to undergo renovation mould in bathroom housekeeper in th floor was so rude gym has no equipment at all i r didnt work this hotel has a rate of star nothing much very basic indian breakfast not worth to pay
916,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good sleek hotel centrally located its a sleek hotel we had some issues with breakfast bookings nut were sorted out by our travel agent make sure you have everything printed and in hard copy before you enter the place its centrally located little india is walkable distance and also subway stations nearby breakfast good and manager a was a bengali person and was good at his job
917,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,good hotel good hotel can stay for night food can be outside the hotel parking is there service can be btter and one should have beeen in agra should visit taj mahal and cleanliness is there and parking is fine
918,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel hotel is clean but rooms were small room size doesnt matter that much since you are not here to stay in the room staff was pleasant and helpfulbreakfast is reasonably good the a la carte menu in the restaurant if you need to have lunch should improve rooms need better sound proofing overall a good hotel
919,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,very small rooms we around people stayed in this hotel between th and of jan in this hotel pros a good location b good ambience cons a a very very small room maybe you can find bigger rooms in this hotel please check the ones we got was very small b not very friendly staff c very small restaurant if all the rooms are full you cant get breakfast d poor quality food rating you can choose an alternative hotel as a last option
920,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,closer hotel to mrt rochor staying in this hotel for night returning back from hongkong was very nice mrt station just meter this is my favorite hotel in singapore and very sure i will stay in this hotel in singapore again close mrt close bugis area close to a lot of food court nearby sim lim buildingetc very kind staff mmhhnothing everything is ok
921,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,budget travel it doesnt fit the bill of a regular hotel as it doesnot have its own restaurant coffee shops etc mostly frequented by asisns as gueststhe place offers a budget stay with no frills efficiently managed it has a tie up with a restaurant located in the same building for breakfast breakfast is based on the coupons and other meals you need to pay up there itself and not through the hotel bill rooms are small but that is the nirm in singapore its kept clean and tidy
922,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,mrt just around the corner rochor mrt is just around the corner only require minutes walking to reach the infamous bugis street market the executive room comes with an average size like any other hotels in singapore but equipped with suitable amenities my baby loves staring at the pool and we enjoyed swimming there too
923,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,close access to rochor mrt station my main consideration on booking this hotel is how it is pretty close to mrt station about mins walk and the price is quiet good i recommend booking through their website rather than through rdparty website through the reception desk you can also buy discounted tickets to various tourist objects in the city the room is pretty standard although probably it suits better for single traveler with short duration of stay bathroom amenities also available so that you need to bring your own
924,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,just okay the hotel looks old the room is small there is nothing much to say about this hotel the pool view is just okay maybe more works should be done to this hotel as it is quite pricey other than that the check in was super slow as hell
925,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,near bugis street clean rooms located just short walking distance away from bugis street night market however need taxi to travel to other places as no mrt station is nearby the surrounding is quiet in evenings nice clean cosy rooms has a small swimming pool hotel staff are friendly and helpful
926,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,perfect location stayed here for a night with my family the hotel is perfect for shoppers like me few steps away from bugis where you can find cheap items and souvenirs near food shops such as mcdonalds burger king etc few steps away from train and bus station thou the room was small but they got friendly staff to accommodate you
927,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,maybe ok for an overnight stay we recently stayed at this hotel for five nights on a friends recommendation too long the biggest problem was trying to sleep on our numerous trips to singapore we have usually slept with the air conditioner turned off after cooling the room down and just sleep with a top sheet but as the room is so pokey it gets stuffy very quickly and then there is no top sheet not our custom or liking at all the air con blows on your body so you then need to use the doonaduvetcomforter which becomes too hot this means ramping up the air con which did not seem to have a thermostat so it ran continuously not sure why a winter type bed covering is used in this climate instead of a sheet and light blanket and maybe air con is cheap to run in singapore the mini wardrobe
928,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,it is worth the stay this is the second time we stayed in this staff are very friendly and willing to help front desk are very helpful they assisted us when my husband had a gout attack staff are very friendly we will definitely stay here again
929,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,worse hotel we were there for a family vacation while we knew the room was small we didnt anticipate it would be so small to even keep our bags also we generally travel light for three of us for a week stay we just had suitcase which we found very hard to accommodate in our small room secondly hotel decided to stop buffet breakfast due to some renovations and we were not even informed on checking with the agent who had booked our stay we realized hotel had not even informed them we very very shoddy service after a lot of fight they decided to accommodate our breakfast in their sister hotel min walk which again the spread was quiet bad for amount they charged us overall not very positive experience not recommended for stay with families
930,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,just terrible such a beautiful building from outside but very small rooms thats ok but same breakfast everydayreally terrible being a vegetarian i was offered idli and upma for consecutive days on complaining to reception staff they told that they dont have a restaurant of their own they outsource it no housekeeping available after pm seriously a below average hotel
931,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,budget hotel location is one of the good points of the hotel everything is available nearby rooms are clean and spacious service is a little poor rest everything is okay breakfast is not too good but manageable
932,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,good location and property no service though for adults and kidyrs old executive room is okay if you are okay to share the bed they dont provide extra bedding and room has no space for it pros location close to little india one can walk down for breakfastdinner rocher mrtbus stop is also walkable neat and clean premises quite location not noisy eleven store just beside the hotel for any day to day stuff there is another shop opposite hotel too singapore tourist attraction passes are available at discounted prices cons housekeeping staff skips room cleaning quite often my room was not cleaned on a couple of days during by nights stay there i overheard other customers too complaining about it i needed an extra towel for which i was asked to collect it myself as
933,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,budget accommodation well located located just off rochor very close to little india the highlight of the hotel is its location nearly everything is conveniently located the summary a good location diverse restaurants around serving global cuisine orchard road little indiaclarke quay gardens by the bay all a short drive away b tiny rooms smallest ive ever seen c helpful and courteous staff d not a full service hotel no bell boys to help with luggage no room service e breakfast is i think procured externally mix of local dishesenglish breakfast and indian breakfast decent spread however the fact that it serves in plastic plates and styrofoam cups kills the joy during my stay the place ran out of food twice well before the time f ideal for those who intend to spend major time
934,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,small but comfortable nice hotel to stay on low budget nothing many luxury items even in the lobby but rooms are great hot water always available th floor large nice pool king size bed with a comfortable bed breakfast mixed with indian and western good variety tastes lot
935,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel this is a no frills hotel cheap and comfortable nothing fancy the hotel was clean and close enough to major areas with little india and bugis within a kilometer if you are on a tight budget or need a place to sleep only then this hotel is for you my wife and i were transiting for two nights and a day we just needed a place to sleep and leave our luggage and this place was more than adequate at the price
936,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,shoebox rooms poor breakfast we stayed here as our cruise company booked this hotel after our cruise great location as its walking distance to sim lim shopping centre little india and bugis street but the rooms are like a shoe box we couldnt even fit our suitcases anywhere once we had sorted our luggage very minimal hanging space and soooooo noisy continual groups and noisy passengers in hallways chatting to all hours please put a do not disturb outside your room at night otherwise the room attendants will want to clean your room at am breakfast was very poorlimited choices and was served with plastic cutlery and plates we complained and were told that someone else rents out this space as the hotel has no food and beverage outlets of its own nice pool as a redeeming feature but i would never
937,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,small and tidy room nice hotel located closer to little indiaroom is small even the bathroom is small you have to make adjustments to keep your luggage everything else was neat and clean was given access to swimming pool and gym kettle is provided tap water is used for drinking water was crystal clear was surprised hotel was under renovation during our stay complimentary indian breakfast was parcelled to us highly recommended for first time travellers to singapore
938,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great location visited the hotel in late september for two nights arrived early for book in and asked to have the room early they were very accomadating and the price was very reasonable cant thank them enough especailly after a long flight room was small but clean reception were very helpful as well as the conceige its in a great area for little india and mrt to airport and bugis markets and some great eaterys in the village court including a indian and a italian great food
939,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,i am staying here since room nos and no tour operator should send tourists or no tourist should check in at to parc sovereign in singapore it not only has crampy and crappy rooms even its staffs including even the bellboys treat guests with utter disdain i have compared one hotel bang opposite to parc sovereign its name starts with villagea far better hotel with courteous and understand guests better the pillowcover was torn to make worse things worst the washrooms do not have any ventilation at all my stay here unfortunately still going on as i have already paid for the rooms is pathetic and its the worst stay i ever had till date anywhere
940,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,quiet convenient location room is small but virtually clean we arrived earlier than checkin but were given our rooms right away nice location quiet but very convenient there is an mrt station nearby sim lim little india and bugis all within walking distance friendly and helpful staff
941,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,pleasant stay stayed with my family for nights in the st week of october rooms though a bit cramped up are very comfortable mr samsudin who was the floor manager was very courteous and friendly camille fara and the other hotel staff were also friendly the hotel is at close proximity to food joints and little india all in all a nice place for family stay with value for money
942,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,budget hotel near to little india and mrt this is average budget hotel near to little india in singapore we stayed in superior room which is very small budget room good for just sleeping mattress quality is also average compared to any other hotels being an indian and veterinarian close proximity to little india was big advantage there are many indian restaurants such as anand bhavan serve authentic indian food there is another restaurant shish mahal next to parc sovereign who server food beyond pm so dont have to sleep hungry if you reach late another advantage of this hotel is two nearby mrt stations little india and rochor
943,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,excellent location the location of the hotel is very good the staff was very friendly the rooms were clean the cafe of the hotel is also nice but the breakfast served which was included in our booking was very average
944,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent location very nice hotel with all the amenities staff is very corteous giving all the information about travelling and sightseeing correctly very helpful special thanks to samsudin camille kelvin for thier smooth check in and check out rooms are good and hotel is centrally located
945,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent hands down the best choice as midrange option in singapore the hotel is conveniently located close to mrt rochor and in a few walking minutes from bugis street the rooms are small but clean and comfortable my bed was comfy and i found room service was good and the staff friendly you have the option to storage your luggage for free you can ask for an handy phone to navigate your way on the streets they even mail your postcards all in all if i ever return to singapore i will stay at this hotel again
946,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,clean and comfortable hotel i had nights there i was happy with my stay hotel is clean and tidy opposite is rochor mrt station very convenient if you purchase tour tickets at front desk it saves you a few bucks compares to outside generally i like the hotel and will come back except one thing on my first day housekeeping knocked my door at am to make up room while i was still sleeping where on earth which hotel would do that that was very annoying to me but i learnt my lesson i hang do not disturb board in front of my room the last two days were fine so please take note if you dont to be distributed at in the morning
947,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great location and a very nice clean secure if small hotel room the location is ideal the room very clean the staff very friendly very close to energetic street life and mrt access the only negativeand it is an important one is that the room is very tight and rather spartan we booked an executive room which we thought was an upgrade over the superior room which makes me wonder how small the superior room must be our room was rather like a nice college dorm room as there was no real sitting area only a counter running along the wall at the foot of the bed with a chair we had to call down to the desk to request a second chair or we wouldve had to sit on the bed there is no room for a table still unless you spend a ton of time in your room it is very serviceable the bathroom was clean and serviceable the pool is
948,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,well located hotel we a group of senior citizens fromindia were very well received at the hotel reception by mr shamsudin and he facilitated check in quite comfortably he very patiently replied to all our queries about singapore breakfast is not very well spread but one can fill his tummy with limited items one thing is very disappointing that they give only small bottles of drinking water per day per room it is very near to little india and bugis street bus stop and train station is very close
949,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel near little india stayed at this hotel for nights with my family apart from few hiccups in checkin formalities everything was smooth room size is small but i guess this is the same story with every property in singapore breakfast menu is good i personally liked the indian menu little india and metro station is at walkable distance i got a mobile phone which was complimentary with my room which was very helpful during my stay guess what india calling was free of cost from the phone in all it is a great place to stay will definitely recommend it to my friends
950,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,friendly staff nice reasonable price our group of people stayed here for nights from aug the hotel is at nice place near the mrt bus stop near the sim lim square for anyone like to go shopping for electronic devices what i like the most when staying here is i could walk around the lasalle college of the art in front of the hotel so peaceful so artful the breakfast is included in the price there is not much choice for breakfast but it is ok for me staffs are very friendly i even made friends keep contact of some staffs there
951,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,a nice stay the best thing about this hotel is the location you come out of the hotel and the area is teeming with restaurants and steet markets but its not chaotic its pleasant bugis street is just less than a kilometre away staying at this hotel you can explore so much on foot like little india bugis street etc the restaurants are really good the bummer is the cramped rooms the rooms are neat n comfortable but the rooms and specially the bathrooms are really compact
952,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good property rooms were clean but not enough space but obvious spacious rooms in singapore cost more enough to put hole through ur pocket hotel gave us free smartphone per room for use during our stay so that we can communicate with other its located in the food n shopping district hence its an advantage
953,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,the best hotel and staff in singapore great location close to food and shopping min walk to bugis and min walk to little india awesome staff extremely helpful and pleasant a big thank you to ej jai natasha haimi suphian and all other staff members that looked after us so well we cant wait to see you all again when we return

956,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,as long as you do not expect a quiet stay the hotel is fine but if you are hoping for some silence your indian neighbors who are btw majority given that little india is across the street will give you a very very hard time btw breakfast is limited to indian food guess why so if you dont appreciate as it is unfortunately my case youll be better off getting breakfast somewhere else
957,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice located hotel very popular among indian tourists location of the hotel is awesome its in between the bugis market chinese and little india indian also the vicinity has department stores like where you can buy daily stuff like milk breads if required vicinity also has an indian restaurant called shish mahal and czech microbrewery along with few other restaurants checkin and front desk check in time at the hotel is pm and you may usually get rooms earlier by or front desk staff is very courteous rooms room size is small and does not accomodate extra bed overall decent room with decent facilities food breakfast is served as a buffet and is not lavish but wholesome indian food idly and upma was served on two days but not everyday facilities hotel houses a gym and a swimming pool at

962,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great staff i would agree that the rooms arent huge but we did fine with two people and four suitcases the location is in little india so a lot of indians use this hotel they can be very loud so be forewarned i was impressed by the security associated with the rooms your key card is used on the elevator to access your floor you are also in the area of a lot of restaurants if you like chinese andor indian food now to the best partthe staff on our final day we were supposed to be picked up at our driver didnt show up but the staff stepped up they contacted the company to determine what was going on and then stepped in to fix the problem and made sure we got to the airport in time to make our flight i cant thank them enough one more observation if you arent into

965,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,small rooms i stayed here with my wife and year old kid hotel room was too small for people to stay generally singapore hotel rooms are small but this is so tiny that you dont even have space for your luggage very small wardrobe and the bathroom was the smallest i have ever seen in my life avoid the place if you have no option otherwise
966,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great customer service quite rush to hold my event at their meeting room yesterday june yet the staffs have been very accommodating and helpful to my requests they extended their help to decorate the room as needed they go way and beyond my expectation thank you so much camille angel ej and kelvin on top of that our room is clean and cozy great for families my little boy enjoyed the pool too will definitely recommend to friends visiting singapore
967,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,horrible and beware truly the most disgusting experience i hav ever had in all the hotels that i hav ever visited no hospitality concept rude staff and managers and bad food rooms are very small n not clean leaky walls poor housekeeping
968,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,regret to stay in this hotel the ad states it is a star hotel the buffet food served is simple fried rice only rice indian dole with curry bread milk breadthe salad is not fresh and after taking the food i feel like vomiting have an indian smell the guest have no manners the kids using their bare hands to take the food my sitting place was occupied when i went for second round have to sit outside the ad at the coffe house have nice pictures saying that it serves western food but i felt cheated no wonder the restaurant is empty except for breakfast
969,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,worst hotel experience the worst hotel ever visited no house keepingthey dont even bother to clean the rooms properly staff not cooperative at all there are several other things i hated about this hotel top of everything rooms are tooooooo small etc etc
970,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,small rooms small size rooms nearest indian restaurant shish mahal mins walking to little india or you spend in morning and in evening after due to peak charges food is below average especially for indians not much of choice and whatever they serve you cannot have staff is courteous very helpful they gave me both the rooms on same floor no indian channels on tv so if you have kids better take your laptop or avoid this hotel
971,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,tiny rooms well this hotel is being offered by many indian travel companies and is good hotel but only problem that we felt was rooms were way to small and breakfast menu was very limited for indian most of the guest looked indian but the breakfast buffet did not cater to them check in time in mos of the places in singapore is pm and is a problem hotel staff is friendly and very helpful and if you want to leave your luggage at reception on early arrival they will help you
972,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,a basic sleep and go hotel the room is really basic in furnishing small room and a small bathroom decently clean not a place if you want to stay a few nights to relax buffet breakfast is simple at additional price only good its near the mrt station a few minute walk away and convenient store are nearby reception staff is nice enough i couldnt find much choice of food around hotel as i check in late evening and checking out early

975,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great stopover hotel we only stayed here for one night enroute to our cruise ship our experience was that it was a clean friendly hotel and close to most places youd want to visit on flying visit youd need to stop for longer if you want to go further afield to see all that singapore has to offer and it has a lot believe me breakfast was plentiful but dont expect a full fry up i recommend this hotel for shortish stays only
976,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,good budget hotel with small rooms parc sovereign hotel albert st is a good hotel the service is very good it has rooftop pool and a very small gym with basic equipment the hotel offers taxi service drop to airport with additional cost breakfast laundry it is very near to mrt metro services rochar station is just mins walking and little india is around mins by walk there is convenient store on the ground floor of this hotel which is an added advantage the staffs are very helpful and are always there whenever needed they do tell that they have children play area but that only features a small slide so dont expect much from playarea the swimming pool in m deep all throughout no separate zone for kids they do have floating ring for kids the rooms are small with queen size

980,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,not a good choice for location we arrived early in the morning and were told if we wanted to access the room it would be another sgd this was outrageous they had had or payment since august you could not access the pool before am when its degrees at you have to be kidding the hotel was very busy mainly indian tourist and the breakfast was not of our choosing and cost per person a joke
981,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great accomodation the parc sovereign hotel albert st is located in albert street parc sovereign hotel singapore comfortable beds provided with basic amenities and had a small balcony swimming pool was clean and and cafe were adjoining with the hotel rooms are small but when you think about it they are only a place to sleep and shower so we didnt find this too much of a problem
982,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,small room great location the price can be better for the size of the room but the location is great right beside the mrt station rochor theres a under the hotel the wifi is good the surrounding areas are nice bugis street victoria street and middle road all on walking distance the minus the pool opens at am a little late compare to other hotels not many english tv stations

984,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,central accomodation very friendly hotel very close to train station food halls and markets rooms are small but when you think about it they are only a place to sleep and shower so we didnt find this too much of a problem for the convenience of the hotels location sacraficing a bit of space to be able to tour singapore was worth it
985,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,parc sovereign hotel albert st review general comments we stayed here on bed breakfast basis for nights and days at first we were a little taken up by the size of the room i mean we were not used to staying in such a small unit and the reviews we checked out beforehand didnt somehow cut it compared to our expectations however we were out touring singapore during the day making our time in the room very limited which in turn made it adequate for our purposes the staff were friendly and obliging as well perhaps they had bigger rooms but we didnt know about it since we booked through an agent i cant remember exactly which room we stayed in but it was between what i like about this hotel the most is the location its surrounded by shopping malls sim lim square is just a couple hundred
986,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,albert str very good positioning and very clearly hotel is near little india area and walking distance from the qlark qay we have free wifi at the hotel lobby and rooms very good breakfast with noodles milk bread eggs corn flakes etc
987,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,good location but small room location a fiveminute stroll in the blazing heat to rochor mrt blue downtown line you can see the mrt station from the hotel the hotel was near sim lim mall with foodcourt underneath it lots of food to choose eg local western but beware of unfriendly food stall owners workers they basically dont understand adequate english to take your order correctly there was a subway stall near the foodcourt with workers if youre lucky enough to have the girl serving you youre fine and youll get what you want if the man was serving you youd get no chance of getting your order right checkin was relatively efficient the receptionist informed us that we could use a handy phone with free internet and take it out of the hotel which was really helpful for googling
988,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good price accessible to mrt and shopping this is a budget hotel small room small shower but clean beddings and white towels very near rochor mrt station and bugis shopping district they have free mobile phones that you can bring anywhere and use for unlimited local and international calls plus unlimited internet access cooool
989,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,a budget hotel with budget facilites it was a bit of disappointment right from the lobby room was extremely small we were told that it could sleep adults and a child but that was not the case it was extremely uncomfortable stay hotel had large visitors from india and they were extremely noisy late at night and in the early morning washroom was very small very uncomfortable to take shower location was excellent little india mrt and rocher mrt stations were very close by and so were the many restaurants not likely to consider this place again unless i am alone
990,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,ok hotel with good location hotel location is good breakfast is also good room space is very less in all category of rooms best thing in this hotel is they gave you mobile phone with free internet phone call to singapore to your home country there swimming pool is also good
991,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice city hotel stayed for nights room was relatively small but perfect and convenient for solo traveller inside has flat tv with international channels working tables wardrobe and shower wifi speed was ok breakfast varieties and hospitality level could have been betterlocation wise is also ok overall this hotel is value for money
992,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,not suitable for families this hotel is not suitable for families because the family room is very small in the family room there is not enough space to keep your luggage and just think how you all can move inside the room the bathroom is very tiny and the breakfast is not up to standards i recommend all families to avoid this hotel

997,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,not that impressed we stayed here for nights before our cruise not a great area and minutes from nearest mrt the hotel was only star at best although we cannot fault the cleanliness the rooms were very small and bathroom smaller than the cruise ship tv very limited beds not very comfortable the room was opposite a block of flats which had a karaoke blasting out loudly each evening past midnight the breakfast was not taken because unless you like rice with onion rings then you will go hungry not my cup of tea therefore not much to recommend this hotel except for the pleasant staff
998,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,average experience checking in was a wee bit tiresome i arrived just after lunch and had to wait till pm to get my room front desk staff was friendly enough for check ins and check outs the concierge older gentleman was great thoughkudos to him room was small but clean and comfortable room and washroom amenities were adequate air conditioning was very good cleaning staff very friendly and efficient the swimming pool is such a big plus after a day of running around in the heat not the best location but its close to little india and sim lim tower where its considered electronic paradise i would rather try another hotel if i were to make another trip back to singapore the convenience store just around the corner of the hotel does not sell alcohol after pm apparently
999,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel in singapore good hotel in singapore near to mall and street where you can have shopping near to little india it is walkable minutes walk to little india good staff and good swimming pool in hotel good hospitality
1000,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,this hotel is in a great location reception staff were helpful but thats all we recently had two two night stays at this hotel before and after cruise out of singapore this hotel was part of advertised package we picked the location of the hotel is great close to mrt and to market shop at buggi street reception staff were always helpful and generally smiling the superior double room was a small shoe box the bed for our first two night stay was far too firm felt like we were sleeping on boards there was lots of mildew in the bathroom there were no face washers at all available floor had long dark hairs when we arrived little room to put suitcases or to store clothes there were only four hangers in very small cupboard but they would not hold trousers at all very bad design restaurant at hotel we found buffet breakfast not suitable or
1001,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,small but neat hotel highlight of this hotel is that it is walkable distance from metro station in little india the restuarants are at a stones throw from this hotel there is a north indian restuarant just next door to this hotel it is around mtres to km from metro station rooms are really small however they are maintained well
1002,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,ok for one night stay near mrt i booked this hotel because of the proximity to the mrt initially planning to stay for nights but because theyre booked for the last night i stayed only for days which was to my relief the standard room is very small and although it has a window you cant really open the curtains because people from across apartment can see you therefore for the whole days the curtains were shut my room is dark luckily i only used the room to sleep most of the time i was out for meetings the staff lacks of hospitality theyre polite effective but doesnt seem to smile a lot the porter luggage storage staff was very friendly nice tho check in out was fast smooth wifi was on the slow side compared to singapore standard but it was working fine i lost my
1003,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,clean budget hotel staff are friendly and the rooms are clean and well maintained very good location right next to lasalle college of arts and just a min drive from city center good value for money but dont expect anything fancy

1005,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,my business trip hotel in singapore i many times stayed in this hotel overall this hotel is good for doing business trip but for vacation i think is not very good the room is small and not cozy the tv chanel is few the swiming pool is small and the breakfast food is same menu everyday one of i like is the location near bugis road and brt station so i can shooping or go to another place easily
1006,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great location with small rooms was there with my family last week rooms are small breakfast was same but who cares as the location of the hotel is good services are ok and rooms were clean so i found it ok as per my requirements

1009,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,a room with a noise we booked a deluxe family room for our visit to singapore the room barely fitted the two beds and the bathroom was rather small but what did really bother us was the loud noise that came from the elevator right next to our room it was very loud we complained but they told us we could only change into a double sharing a bed with adults we suggested to switch off the noisy one of the two lifts for the night but we were told that the personell was not authorized willing to do so we asked to speak to the manager but he was only on duty the day after from am which was of course too late for us no willingness to solve the problem or compensate bad service when you book they want prepayment now we know why
1010,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,tour singapore with cruise it was tiring to cover all the main spots in a day in singapore we were for nights at cruise and then singapore for days so we tried to cover main attraction of singapore in a day as per our tour adviser first flight but it was tiring
1011,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,not at all a star hotel i stayed here for a day on nd of february cons the room is too small and the bathroom looked like a public toilet with no bath tub or chamber the ac was noisy and we couldnt sleep throughout night the breakfast was not so good and limited the hospitality is not upto mark you have to call the reception again and again for any service pros the good thing about the hotel is they provide a mobile phone to make free national international calls and internet you can take the phone and roam around singapore the swimming pool is on th floor is good
1012,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,avg hotel in good location i stayed here for days and has booked rooms pros good location cleanliness staff buffet breakfast wifi allow luggage after checkout cons expensive swimming pool timings from am so its hardly of any use lobby and rooms is small so many indian guests but they dont have an inhouse kitchen for indian foods and all dishes comes from nearby restaurant sheesh mahal restaurant is expensive
1013,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,worst hotel to be in singapore one of the worst hotel hospitality ever dont ever stay here coz the rooms are as big as a stansard washroom in a star hotel the food served in breakfast is poor quality with just toast for vegetarians they dont have a bell man for luggage pick up and drop till the room the staff is least bothered about the guests they sound rude they have just few staff to handle the guests the room cleaning is poor the shower area is so small that only half the body fits in it the bed is a single low quality mattress the pillows and towels stink i would suggest not to ever stay here zero value for the money they charge dont stay here ever there are better options in this budget indians please dont get fooled by the pics of the hotel
1014,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,budget no frills great loacation stayed for days well some of the best things about this property prices are a steal excellent location bang opp rocher mrt a below the hotel front office staff was great shamshudin i guess a manager was of great help this is the perfect place for those who just want a place to crash for the night rooms and bathrooms are clean the only drawback rooms are small ok for squeeze for but with kid along might be a tad uncomfortable
1015,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,excellent hotel and amenities very convenient hotel situated close to mrt stations although rooms were on the small side they were kept clean customer service was excellent checkin and checkout was quick and effortless pool was also fun with the kids
1016,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,nice one it was a pleasant stay good service and friendly receptionist the room are very small but clean and neat they allow us to use a phone with free international call to philippines which is hassle free for us so we dont need to buy the sim card we were allowed to bring it also outside to use for internet browsing helpful people
1017,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,small hotel near public transport hotel just minute walk from mrt station little india a rochor station room was small but compact with all facility the best ist every room has privat handy with this you can free call a internet where ever you go was very good near from shopping mal a local tekka market
1018,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,functional this place is cheap by singaporean standards but clean and well located in bugis the room was small but had all amenities and the bed was comfortable no extraneous noise other than families shouting at each other from room to room but that stopped at childrens sleeping hour it is about min walk from bugis station and there are plenty of eateries in the surrounding area as well as the wellknown bugis tourist street full of cheap goods
1019,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,hotel stay room is comfortable service staff is good namely norizan natasha samsudin facilities such as swimming pool breakfast is acceptable wifi also good but gym facilities need to provide more equipment
1020,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,a pleasant surprised i loved the parc sovereign it is by far the best hotel ive stayed in in singapore and for its price compared to others at similar price its amazing first of all the location right next to all public transport but easy walk to many shopping areas and amenities was helpful having a right underneath as well i didnt eat at the restaurant but had room service once and it was quick and delicious the hotel is located in a nice safe area i enjoyed wandering around exploring this neighbourhood the hotel itself is fantastic very clean and modern i had a room that opened out onto the pool area which i loved but beware that during the day youll get a lot of noise from pool users and not so much privacy in these rooms however that was fine by me as i could
1021,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,a good deal we stayed for days in parc sovereign during our trip in singapore this hotel is located next to lassale singapore and very close to rochor mrt it is also quite near to bugis areabugis junction minutes walk room not too big but still slightly bigger than hotel bed quite comfortable facilities it has a swimming pool and gym facilities did not try the gym but the swimming pool was quite okay location i find it quite convinient because it is close to a mrt station rochor mrt station and bugis area where you can find shopsrestaurantssouvenirs and also quite near to little india breakfastdining our room rates did not include breakfast so cannot comment on that overall if you are travelling to singapore on a budget this hotel is
1022,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,great location average in general the room was so small breakfast was alright as we stayed at th floor the sleep quality was good no noise apart from that its well located a few minutes walking distance to rochor mrt stop little india sim lim square bugis junction
1023,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,a stay to remember a good hotel with value not expensive accessible location friendly receptionist provided a phone with free call to philippines however rooms are small and no space for luggage but its ok as we just stay in the room for sleeping thank you
1024,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,decent suit the price nice place to stay near bugis and sim lim square easy to find food comfortableclean and i love the swimming pool it looks so nice from the top suitable for couples or solo cause the room is abit small but not too small the price suits the room that i got so far no complaints loved it
1025,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,not worth it was booked for this hotel for my day stay centrally located but when i entered the room i was disappointed too small i had luggage of two suitcases which when placed in the room left me with no room to move about in the room bathroom area is feet by feet such is the area the tv had only channels out ot which were in the local language one bbc news the other movies and another sports channel and one a south indian language channel is that the choice for an international tourist there is only one large window for the room and when i went to open it i saw another housing complex staring in my room that was the first and the last time i opened the room the receptionist on the day i landed in singapore the jan was the worst i could meet forget
1026,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,service staff very good the hotel service is very nice especially the service staff such as natasha norizan and xin shan the room view is nice beautiful the hotel surrounding is very nice and have many food centre around it

1032,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice cozy hotel excellent location courteous staff breakfast is good you can access both little india bugis mrt stations kids enjoyed rooftop pool a lot the only downside is small rooms hotel needs to do something about soundproofing as noise from lobby was reaching our room
1033,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great location great stay close to markets city buses great resturant rooms and pool super staff accomodating close to little india and many dine i dine out places nd time there no reason not to go back again sometime
1034,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,nice location hotel location is superb near to little india mustafa market bugis street all at walking distance also mrts rochar stop is at walking distance so commuting is easy rooms are too small sufficient for a couple but not for family daily breakfast menu remains same hence boring staff is good and provide all necessary things in room and keeps room clean too and lastly those who are looking for veg restaurants nearby this hotel is good option
1035,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,my first visit this is my first visit at this particular parc sovereign hotel the receptionists by the name of kaffil norizan xin shin did an excellent job in serving us both were friendly and gave us proper informations the room that we were given was great and nice to stay i will definitely be back thank you for the hospitality

1040,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,not so organized the room is typical singapore midlow range size this is a good part of the hotel and they offer free wifi there is a breakfast option at sgd per pax however you can enjoy local breakfast lunch and dinner with more variety and cheaper price by walking to minutes however the check in procedure is quite mess i was informed that they will call me up for check in but end up it didnt in the end i just walk up straight to ask for check in the housekeeping seems alittle under staff we left our room at am with a sign board to request for housekeeping after return at pm the housekeeping still not yet done overall the room price still not so worth it might because new year period if lesser than might be worth it
1041,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great location for sure the hotel is well located within minutes walking distance to little india for those looking for fabrics gifts and jewellery minutes to the hipster looking surroundings of arab street and a short stroll to the famous bugi street rooms are clean a bit small but the staff will move you around if there other rooms available well priced in my opinion nice swimming pool the breakfast can improve a lot definitely not a breakfast for westerns as it is asian focused overall great experience i can recommend to friends and family
1042,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,satisfied nice room good for adult and kidskind staff breakfast is simpleclean lobby and clean roomnear in shopping area quite location eleven is in the same buildingif i will visit singapore again i will book again at parcsovereign hotel albert
1043,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,small room and average service room was very small reasonably clean some of the routine stuff were missing and had to be asked for ie toilet paper front desk staff was helpful however the overall impression about the hotel was average
1044,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice getaway room is clean and comfortable location was accessible to nearby amenities at most a minutes walk away supermarket hawker centers are nearby only gripe is that the lighting seemed dark on the shower side of the bathroom bed and pillows are invitingly comfortable had a good rest away from busy singapore

1047,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,caution caution warning all travellers looking to book this property must beware of the room sizes on offer they are smaller than an average cabin in india i was nearly speechless when we checked into the rooms we could not even walk straight or open our luggage and overall really bad buffet breakfast and lunch served at the ground floor restaurant i am giving an average rating to this property only because they changed our rooms on complaining and they allow free local and international calls from their handy phones in the rooms which can be carried outbof the hotel during your stay
1048,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,professional excellent location easy access to mrt services are very good they even have handy for use in singapore with free international calls breakfast buffet was average rooms are tad small

1052,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,absolutely love amazing value myself and a friend stayed in this hotel last week whilst travelling and it is by far the nicest hotel weve stayed within our budget on this trip and i think we will struggle to find anything living up to the reputation of this hotel the rooms were lovely piping hot water very clean and each room has a balcony with egg type chair outside it is located minutes walk from lavender underground station which will take you absolutely anywhere you want to go cleaners changed sheets and towels daily sometimes we failed to get up until pm and we would still arrive back to find theyd cleaned our room i didnt eat in this hotel so cannot comment on food however any tea bags coffee etc required they would deliver to your room they claim to have a gym but if thats the case i
1053,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,middle class hotel in little india we were as a couple for three days in singapore and choose this hotel due to its prize and the near mrtstation the hotel is located in little india and you have to walk about five minutes for the next mrt station rochor or little india if you arrive to changi airport shuttle for sgd which brings you directly to the hotel in about minutes it is very easy to catch a shuttle the checkin checkout in the hotel was fast and we had a room in the th highest floor in the hotel the room is not to big but sufficient for a city trip unfortunately the rooms are very clairaudient and it was really loud in our room regarding the neighborhood the staff members are friendly and helpfully all in all a good city hotel without any luxurious facilities for us it is more a
1054,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great hotel in great location my husband and i enjoyed our night stay at the parc soveriegn this hotel is extremely good value for singapore and in such a great location for getting around and exploring so close to rochor mrt station and only a to minute walk to orchard road or raffles city it very close to little india arab st and bugis too with lots of places to shop and eat close by it has a small gym and a nice pool and area to relax in we did not eat in the hotel but it does have a small caferestaurant the rooms are small but clean and comfortable the hotel could do with a little upgrading to the lobby and rooms but it is clean tidy and the staff are so nice and helpful norizan kalfir samsuddin and nurul are always there with a friendly smile and a willingness to help i would
1055,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,one of the best very recommended been to so many different hotels here but nothing like this one parc sovereign hotel on albert street is one of the best so far very welcome staffs and who can say no good and strategic locations with a good price i arrived on th of december approximately pm and one of the staffs kaffil come and approached me to help me with the checkin prochedure while others staffs that timenurul samsudin were busy and patiently taking care other guests and even while i wait for kaffil to finish with my documents and checkin prochedure norizan one of the staffs came to ask me whether i need helps and in the end they upgraded my room and also the hotel provides us with one mobile phone for each room which i can use for calling my home country indonesia for free
1056,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,manageable pros location is fine wifi is free and super fast friendly staff manageable room amenities good housekeeping empty surprsingly comes with handy smartphone with free g cons room is very basic and extremely small even for two people
1057,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great value accommodation in heart of singapore our stay at the parc sovereign was a very pleasant one our room was small but very clean and it had all the facilities we needed including a comfortable bed desk coffee making facilities and bathroom for two people of average size this is a great option however if two large people were staying in the room they may find the size of the room a little uncomfortable the hotel facilities are limited but the pool is a great place to unwind its rarely got many people in it so its easy to go for a dip without having numerous people around you there are also a plethora of towels at the level with the pool the breakfast was one of the big let downs at this hotel it was quite possibly one of the worst ive had and i usually stay in hostels largely because all of
1058,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,singapore hotel my first time singapore tour was as memorable as i expect it it is a very developed country with organize and clean sorroundings very modern in every way the metro train station is high tech the tourist places were interesting and impressive and people are welcoming we stayed in parc hotel at bugis and we really have a nice stay thank you for the good service and comfortable rooms love it
1059,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,convinient hotel and location stay in this hotel for day only so far i may consider that it was a decent stay the hotel rooms are really small as compared to other hotels but from its price it is so far good its clean and location is just amazing near to trains and bus stops people are so friendly the staff were attentive and helpful will recommend this place to my friends and relatives
1060,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,good location stayed with my wife and kids from dec good place for the cost if with kid also recommend taking family room rooms are pretty small which i think is normal in singapore the family room had queen bed and single bed as seen from other reviews also the noise from the aisles are quite disturbing inside the rooms small but clean toilet with normal toiletries towels etc changed daily room has fridge safe tv kettle etc we had opted for breakfast included but it has very limited variety below average breakfast the good things are as follows great location walking distance to bugis street area with lots of street shopping and one department store og walking distance to little india decent food joints right next to the hotel at the albert square and
1061,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great service my friend and i stayed here for nights and i must say that i had a pleasant stay thanks to natasha and norizan they were very helpful and patient with us because we explained to them that we wanted to book the hotel room with balcony but we accidentally booked the one without balcony instead however they managed to accommodate to our request and changed our room instead i would definitely come back again

1063,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,not bad we stayed here for nights prior to going on a cruise from singapore it was quite central the rooms were very small but clean you could make free phone calls to europe which was very useful you could also take the mobile phone with you when you left the hotel which was good as it gave lots of useful information the breakfast was ok but was too small for the amount of people who wanted breakfast the view from the room wasnt good but it didnt matter for nights
1064,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,average hotel with a mobile phone of unlimited calls to india we stayed in this hotel for two days gud hotel rooms are clean average space service is poor they only provide two bottles of water and dont rwfuel the tea coffee bags and dont provide extra towels average swimming pool service is average and very rude food for vegetarians very limited options for them only one thing that favour them they provide a mobile which allows tourists to call for ten countries free free internet and also allow them during their stay at hotel to take mobile with them outside you have to deposit this mobile at checkout only

1075,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,extremely disappointed rude arrogant staff extremely disappointed very rude arrogant staff specially a girl restaurant she talk to my mother very rudely in an unmannerly way while she was filling water in her bottle from the restaurant buffet counter doesnt seems to me from a hospitality sector or may be doesnt know the meaning of hospitality or customer satisfaction room size was also extremely small bathroom also not much big have been to so many international destinations till now have visited more than star category hotels but this is my worst experience till now no microwave facility neither in room nor available in common only best unique part is that they provide a g activated mobile phone in the room for calls internet which is totally free during the stay which we can also take

1093,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,family break with young children when we arrived at this hotel the room was incredibly dirty with blood on the walls in the bathroom and in the sink we asked for a new room but the hotel was full so they sent someone to clean the room who took about minutes for someone to actually come to our room to clean it the overall cleanliness of the hotel was better than my room but still not as high as i would have expected once clean the hotel was good the location is excellent barely m from the mrt station and close to bugis little india and easy to get to marina bay the staff were hit and miss some excellent some poor the pool was ok but the pool area was small just to reiterate the location is the best element of this hotel

1095,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice hotel cold hospitality and great location main reason for opting this hotel was its location little india bugis rochor mrt stations and bus stop are all within short walking distance rooms are small with average decor and equipped with amenities like safe electric kettle hair dryer toiletries and slippers room was clean hotel has a pool on forth floor on the down side sound proofing of the rooms is a concern one could hear voices from other rooms and passage my stay with hotel ended with sour experience on checking out i had to bring down my own luggage from my room after hotel staff failed to provide any service in this regard

1112,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,star kindly recheck rating system i have booked this hotel in fact i was misguided by pathetic tour services imonholidayscom india and rayna tour singapore day for st time no bell boy is there to take your luggage to room no one to tell where lift is with night flight and delayed pick up by tour guides you enter room and you find out its a small air conditioned stood roomed which was so intelligently captured on camera to miss lead customers bathroom is a x smallest space possible i called up the front desk and was told this is it you have to stay as no more rooms available the worst decision was to take service from imonholidayscom as they have one reply to all queries sorry shikhaimonholidayscom my sales representative was good in sales but bad in keeping promises of making it a

1114,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,problem encounter but hotel no acting on it the hotel room is quite standard although the room is small the big problem is hotel staff andor management is not acting on complaint i got a cut on my feet in the bed in the morning and found one broken needle in the mattress made a complaint to the counter staff when checking out and leave my name email phone and demand for a reply from the hotel after week past nothing hear from the hotel very bad will never return stay at your own risk
1115,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,second visit just as good opted to stay at parc sovereign again and was not disappointed the rooms are small but cozy and they are cleaned up everyday we got an early check in when we requested it and the stay was completely hassle free the internet enabled handy mobile phone that came complementary with the room free of all charges for voice and data was a very nice surprise that was very useful in navigating and checking out restaurants and bars online
1116,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,budget hotelvery very small room room size very small wish the rooms were a little bigger centrally located near little india mustafa market breakfast buffet almost same every alternate day and not too great in taste staff was good and helpful
1117,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,robertson family had a great stay in this hotel good quiet location for the family the travel agent we used messed up our room booking and the staff ck asyraf doris and natasha at the hotel could not have been more helpful in sorting it out for us they went above and beyond as we tired and cranky after a hour travel to get it sorted and make us feel relaxed and welcome so big thanks to them all of the staff were very friendly rooms were clean pool was great i would definitely recommend staying at the parc sovereign
1118,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,very pleasant stay me and my family stayed at this hotel book them online when we check in the front liners asyraf ck and doris were very helpful they provide us very helpful information regarding our stay and did their best to make our stay enjoyable if theres one thing to be fix it would be the internet connection on the rooms since it was quite hard for me on getting the wifi other than that it was a very pleasurable stay
1119,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,excellent service i love the service provided by afa and asyraf who were very helpful they made my th birthday extra special and very memorable i would certainly recommend my friends to stay at your hotel as it is very convenient and central to get to many places

1122,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent located next to the famous electronics mall sim lim square this hotel is better known to the cabbies as albert hotel since it is located on albert street as against another hotel of the same name located elsewhere but somewhere nearby another landmark for the cabbies is the village hotel which is adjoining the albert street parc sovereign hotel best for stay
1123,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great stay great location my room was upgraded to king size bed and i was able to check in earlier the staffs seveneafakaffy were nice and friendly this was my nd stay but this time my stay was much more better with the new mrt station rochor stationjust few steps away from the hotel exploring singapore was faster and more enjoyable
1124,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,clean and wellmaintained hotel great location great value for the price and good for small families centrally located with friendly staff and all the modern amenities the staff was kind enough to upgrade us when there was an issue with our room especially travelling with young kids which is much appreciated
1125,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,a decent hotel for a short stay in singapore located next to the famous electronics mall sim lim square this hotel is better known to the cabbies as albert hotel since it is located on albert street as against another hotel of the same name located elsewhere but somewhere nearby another landmark for the cabbies is the village hotel which is adjoining the albert street parc sovereign hotel the basic rooms are pretty small in size for two people to open out their suitcases the housekeeping staff do a good job of keeping the premises quite clean and shining the breakfast buffet has not too much of a choice but adequate enough if you feel energetic enough a swimming pool is available on the th floor check in time is only by pm so if you arrive early you will have to wait till the rooms are made available
1126,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great service the staff is very friendly and centrally located great ambience and great view from the room very recommended and thank you for a free upgrade hotel definitely a hotel to stay and plus coming here for ultra music and great accesss as the train stations is only minutes away
1127,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice hotel centrally located a nice place for a small family very centrally located close to all major tourist attractions the staff is very cordial and friendly a big kudos to kaffil and norizan for their assistance and helpful attitude
1128,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,clean decent hotel in a convenient location a few years back we stayed in albert court hotel when we noticed this parc sovereign hotel right in front it so this year we decided to try it for a stay we didnt regret it yes the room may be smaller than what youre used to weve been to even smaller rooms than this but at a more expensive cost but at the budget price you pay you have to be realistic bring down your expectations we found the executive room to be very clean comfortable our child had a good long sleep the swimming pool mini playground are simply charming theres even an ironing board provided in the room which doesnt exist in most of the star rated hotels here so we are very grateful for that location wise its convenient to get anywhere as theres a train station nearby
1129,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,a great hotel a great hotel with great staff especially samsudin who is an asset to the hotel always able to sort out any requests we had great front man for the hotel also a great location handy to supermarket food outlets little india and burgis pool great rooms fine for nice and clean can not ask for any more
1130,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,dont let the hotel pictures fool you i would say this is stars hotel hotel stuffs very casual front desk no warm greeting housekeepers not smiling hotel rooms need to deep clean and remodel bed sheets need to exchange whit old spots usd a night for this hotel is totally not worth not recommend
1131,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,free upgrade and great staff staff are helpfull kudos to the staff kaffil and ck great service and they give us an upgrade for free and early check in as early as am and a late check out they are friendly and accomodating
1132,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,decent stay good location but very small room the hotel offers a decent stay with star amenitiesbest part is the location especially for indian tourists within walking distance was little india locality which has lot of indian restaurants markets bugis st area metro smrt station pool was good the lobby has a massage chair which is wonderful but the worst part was the room size even for a couple without kids we felt totally cramped apart from the bed there was absolutely no moving space in room plus the view from our room was not good all we could see were clothes hanging from windows of a residential building but we understand that most star hotels in singapore have space constraint during typical tourist stay in singapore one is likely to spend very little time in hotel parc offers
1133,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,nice location but very small room i stayed in these hotel during my singapore visit with my family the location is very near to little india which has lot of indian shops and restaurants the room are too small and didnt had space for moving in the room the hotel also doesnt have bell desk and u need to carry ur luggage urself breakfast is just an average one and u have better options in little india the room was neat and tidy and complimentary water bottles were provided if u have a short stay this hotel is recommended else u have better hotels at bugis junction if u have small kids they will have little space in the room to play around and this hotel is not recommended
1134,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,nice hotel good hotel in near by prime locations popular between indian tourists and just opposite little india market area rooms are small but same issue with almost all singapore hotels rooms are clean and nice with all basic amenities breakfast is included but very limited choice for vegetarians overall it was a nice stay
1135,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,a fantastic resting place in bugis the lobby of the hotel impressed me at the first sight with comfortable atmosphere and the staff are beautifully hospitable in the reception i was fully supported by their caring and warm welcome you will be happy with samsudin kafiil ck and sarlene kelvin is also very helpful they make your stay home i will come back this hotel with my whole family next time
1136,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great place to stay i had a one night stopover in singapore and chose this hotel due to price and location it was such good value my room and shower were small but was all i needed everything was clean the bed was cosy mostly i was impressed with the staff kaffil samsudin afa kelvin who were so very helpful arranging my transport and giving me very clear directions to find my way around they were a friendly crew indeed i am going through singapore again tomorrow and because of these helpful men and the good rate i have chosen to go back to parc sovereign

1138,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,hotel facilities hotel is very good looking and staff very helpfulbut the rooms are too small for a couple alsowith no faucet facilties in bathroomsits very much not advisable if you are bathroom user attractions given by the hotel is swimming pool which is well maintained
1139,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,exclusive for business and tourists travellers rooms are well appointed and spacious poor tv coverage less than stations to select form of which one was english cnn good location as bochor mrt station is less than mins away walking too busy with bus loads of people pushing and pulling everywhere only supplies breakfast but the large groups make it near impossible to enjoy thoroughly apart form the swimming pool deck no other socialising or relaxing zones wifi of decent quality though good for quick note fast business travellerschool but not outstandingly great
1140,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,great location the best part of the hotel is its location we were in singapore for only three days so the location was perfect for us for out trips the room was very small however it had some good views of the street the staff is not friendly and they should work upon this the breakfast can be improved the indian restaurant next to the hotel is great and there is a discount if you are residing at this hotel unsure if i would stay here again but if location is important to you this hotel is a great choice
1141,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,good hotel near little india stayed here for five days while i was on a vacation with my family it can be used as a base for sight seeing lot of attractions are near by hotel provides free wi fi have a well maintained pool on fourth level and front desk staff is very cooperative hotel rooms are comparatively smaller but very clean and well maintained best part is a micro brewery is on the next door to this hotel it is named hospoda micro breweryprovide authentic czech brew evenings are fun herealfresco settinglaughter alcohol and somebody just started singing while i was there lot of restaurants are nearbyindian restaurants are plenty but mediterranean cuisine and european restaurants are also nearby
1142,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,trip to singapore i am right now in parv sovereign hotel at albert street i request others to stay in this hotel because this hotel is near by littel indiamustafa and orchard roadhotel is good and i request others to stay in this hotel breakfat is also good pls note you have advance booking

1144,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,parc sovereign albert street singapore not a bad place to stay if you need a base for sightseeing very close to tube stops at rocher and little india rooms smallish pool big enough to cool off in during the afternoon restaurant disappointing for breakfast cold fried eggs and beans but toast and coffee good free internet very pleasant staff
1145,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice place we stayed at this hotel in august its a decent hotel value for money the staff is very courteous and helpful specially kaffil and ck who were at the desk on our arrival i would recommend the hotel if you are looking for a reasonable place to stay in singapore during your holiday
1146,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great service was here for a night stay and was served by kaffil kelvin afa service was good and prompt the room i had opened to the swimming pool it was convenient to sim lim square bugis village would come back again
1147,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,small room room was small with a standard double bed not enough space to move not advisable to bring in huge luggage internet conection was slow food in the restaurant is palatable but with small range of dishes to choose from
1148,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,poor standard of hotel stayed at this hotel for nights not very impressed room was tiny contained a standard double bed not enough space to store cases had to put them opp bathroom door and had to squeeze past quite a noisy hotel where the other guests had very little consideration for others breakfast was included and was passable the pictures on the hotel website are misleading people into thinking this is a luxury hotel it is tired and dated inside and the room was only marginally better than the ibis budget on our departure day we asked if there was a room we could use to get changed in after a day in the city and before our taxi arrived for the airport we were assured that there was on our return to the hotel we asked for the details of the room where we could freshen up and
1149,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,ants and small room tiny room and even smaller bathroom we had ants crawling over the cups and bar area and over both side tables bought our own insect repellent as our grievance to reception went unheeded city view room not provided even though it was stated on our booking we were on the fourth floor and it was very noisy with constant doors slamming and people talking loudly till late area was handy to transportshops and restaurants
1150,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,nice place dedicated staff while the parc sovereign is not necessarily luxurious and the internet could be better it is a nice place with very dedicated staff the cleaning staff literally washed some of my dirty clothes without me asking and another staff member was kind enough to check in on me when i was not feeling all that well asyraf and kelvin were particularly helpful
1151,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,excellent had a great timeespecially thankful to reception crew namely ck kaffil kelvinm enlightened n pleasured by the food quality dtaff behaviour n hospitalityrecommend this hotel to all my family frens when they come to singapore

1154,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,location location and service of the hotel is nicesize of the rooms are small breakfast is goodhotel only provide tiny drinking water bottles per day which are insufficiant to our requirements hotel gym only have to equipments of which treadmill was not working swimmingpool is nice and clean
1155,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,small rooms we stayed at the hotel for two nights and had booked for triple sharing but to our shock the rooms were very small there was no place to move in the room or to open your luggage so there was no question of asking for a third bed in the room as there was practically no place for it further the breakfast was also average oversll experience at the hotel was average
1156,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,very small room stayed one night recently room was very small barely enough room to be able to open our luggages bathroom was also small shower curtain smelt mouldy asked hotel staff to change it and they did it efficiently very good location around the corner from little india and the shops and restaurants on serangoon road ok for shortterm stay
1157,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,congested room we stayed days in this hotel room was very congestive difficult to accommodate over here per day water bottles only given my hotel if extra mean it was chargeable it was a bitter experience while stayed here
1158,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,tiny rooms and bad service super tiny room you will definitely be disappointed king size bed is hardly enough for a couple there is hardly any space in lobby to wait if you land early hotel has outsourced restraunt restraunt owner dint allow me to use microwave to warm milk for my daughter instead he asked me to buy milk in unreasonable prices stay away
1159,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,tiny rooms with no facilities we stayed days in this hotel there is no single water dispenser outside your bathroom as bottled water is very expensive in sg we tried to get water from the restaurant but they dont provide and suggest to use the bathroom sync the water may same and good in bathroom but we could not digest the fact that we had to use the bathroom sync if they can provide at least a water dispenser outside that would be good the room size is hardly x part from the bed you can just have you bag thats it restaurant provides american breakfast which is just ok they have a thread mill and another equipment and they call that as a gym we stayed in kl for days where the hotels are much better even taxi drivers dont know this hotel bath shower place is just about x
1160,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,thank you parc sovereign the service from afaasyraf and norizan was great informed us earlier that the room is small for my family and we got an upgrade from them thank you so much hope that to see them again well like to stay here in the future

1162,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel clean and nice hotel with nice staff welcoming us when we first entered sevene kaffi and ck thank you for the stay they provide free parking and a nice swimming pool location is good too and its near many shopping centres
1163,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good hotel i have stay with my family for nights in this hotelthe location of this hotel if idealabout one km to little indiathe breakfast is also goodthis really family hotel the size of rooms are small but i found most of the middle range hotels have small rooms
1164,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great singapore sale shopping was the best part of my holiday singapore sale was all over the place i love orchard road we went to universal clarkquay marina and sentosa and all was just fabulous singapore is a nice place to travel the hotel we stayed is just simple but the whole front office team was good cooperative and helpful love the location very accessible and the hotel rates for me was reasonable
1165,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,awesome hotel near to food shops and train great location indeed room and the cr are kinda small but its clean receptionist are friendly we love the pool at the fourth floor but we just wish that it opens earlier than in the morning but it was an awesome stay
1166,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,quick visit nights arrived at hotel and young gentleman at desk was very pleasant but the girl could do with putting a smile on her face never seen anyone so angry looking she took our passports to photocopy and slammed them about anyway was given room number and on rd floor went into room and very small so just as well we were only there for two nights bathroom clean enough breakfast was ok just had toast but if you liked rice for breakfast you would be fine plenty of barscafes about and a short walk to little india overall a short stay pleasant enough but room too small
1167,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,experience to cherish i was in this hotel with my family for three nights st june to rd june i give this hotel a score of on for the below mentioned reasons staff especially at reception are extremely courteous and helpful the first encounter with them is enough to make you feel at home they act more like guides thank you guys they allotted us a room in th floor trust me the view from the hotel was mind blowing singspore is all about great buildings clean roads cafes good food joints cars etc you get the best possible view of all these things from your room thank you once again hotel is close to little india at a walking distance so travelers fond of indian food have good options here on both sides of hotels there are some good restaurants one
1168,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,overall a good hotel that could be better pros staff members are very helpful and show concern service is good rooms are okkkk unless and until you opt for a good view room which i did after disliking my booked room location wise it is a good hotel and moreover metro is also near buybugis street is also near buy which is very good for shopping cons the restaurant provides same old breakfast every single day and thats also not a very delicious food rooms are small if you like watching television there are really no good channelsin total there are only from which only some are good overall stars a good hotel with some ups and downs
1169,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,travel advice we were prepared to hire a taxi to take us to the gardens of the bay but these helpful hotel staff went out of their way and pointed out to us that there was a metro railway just in walking distance away and that we could get to the tourist attraction by train and a lot cheaper than taxi
1170,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,very good experience stayed here in may good economic propertystaffs are very courteous helpful location wise is walkable distance to mustafa little india arcade good for people who hunt for vegeterian food in singapore there are many restaurants available near by special thanks to the staffs who made us comfortable and shish mahal restaurant which is in the neighbor hood who provided us special veg food even if you want to try different dishes there are multiple restaurants near by also the mrt is mins walkable from the hotel which connects you to many attractions we took taxi service and didnt find it much expensive might be due to the location we opted to stay the pool is decent enough if i look at the negative aspect rooms are too small for a couple but
1171,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,very cozy i have visited hotel it is very cozy room size is like bathroom size it is ftits too small once u enter room the room is finished u cannot stand in room u have sit on bed that it break fast is same all four day no indian food is there worst than the worst for break fast swimming pool is like a drain max ft max to person can swim at a time swimming pool time is also bad open o clock and we have leave oclock for site seeingso what is the use of swimming pool only location us good with this rate there bus lot of hotel there i give onlystar only for location very very bad experience also there r lot if thing but its enough
1172,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great location we stayed one night before flying to koh samui booked before going because the location seemed close to little india which we had never visited on previous singapore trips very happy with location as it was minutes to little india what a place fantastic hotel was ok fairly basic but very pleasant staff and efficient re booked for our return from koh samui and received an up grade which was most appreciated together with a very reasonable cost the hotel is also located to albert place which has a small number of quiet low cost eating places outside under palm trees would recommend park sovereign for folk wanting easy safe access to little india bugis street
1173,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,not truly a star or even star hotel if it is infested with baby cockroaches summarised version hotel claims to be star on their website yes they have a decent swimming pool and a really puny equipment gym but if the property is infested with baby roaches i think the management has a serious hygiene issue to take care of changed a total of rooms upon discovering not but up to baby cockroaches in each rooms including the vip room that the staff claimed to upgrade us to on the rd try yes this even after fumigating the room right before we went in most guests were indian nationals because of its proximity to little india area and mustafa service staff were generally nice and helpful throughout my unpleasant experience with the building not worth the price even if it is inexpensive the building is

1178,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,parc sovereign strategic location a good place to stay rooms though not so big but very comfortable breakfast is just ok as we had almost similar menu for all days hotel is strategically located hence china town mustafa etc are very close one need to plan trip very carefully as most of the travelers in india reach at around am singapore time early checkin is a concern if you are lucky you might get a room otherwise you need to wait for hours having said that spending a good money for international travel waiting in the lobby for checkin is a big disappointment
1179,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,neat clean hotel very neat good breakfast is nice room size is so small difficult to keep our luggage and walk around they provide little bottles of water each day ml if they provide it more then it will be great

1185,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,strategic location small hotel room erratic shower heater pump stayed there for a few nights and found out that this hotel is located in a very strategic location than expected the rochor mrt station was just a stone throw away and easily accessible if you are the type that like to savour the local delicacies choosing this hotel to stay is the right location there are a lot of local foods nearby such as food court and restaurants great local food is available if you walk at bit further to albert centre bugis station is within mins walking distance and the taxi to johor at ban san st queen st is just nearby as for taking taxi to jb take the malaysian registered taxi if you travel from singapore to anywhere in malaysia as for returning from johor bahrusingapore take the singapore registered taxi at larkin sentral and it will

1190,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,dont bother staying there even if the hotel is free my experience was terrible i expected to receive a normal hotel service not a luxury one that happened to my first night stay i found that the basic hardware and software of this hotel is not up to standard at all i dont really understand how they can be stated as a stars hotel the room is really small it is smaller than any budget hotel rooms in tokyo if you have a lot of luggages dont bother staying this hotel the shower place is so tiny that the arms are bumping the wall while taking shower missing tv remote controller i have to make phone calls pm pm after dinner when i return to hotel at pm to reception in order to have the tv remote control delivered in my room nobody seems to believe me that the tv remote controller is
1191,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,so very sovereign i got a lot of recommendations of where to stay when i flew to singapore for a short holiday the best one is parc sovereign hotel strategically located on albert street this hotel is just a few steps away from everything you can afford food fashion and gadgets that you can bargain for the rooms are basic and functional good for a temporary home if you plan to stay for a week the helpful staff always eager to assist this mix culture of singapore is seen in them if you need a place to stay and your trip deserves a little leisure parc sovereign it is
1192,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,low your expectations a part of location do not think of this hotel as place of relaxation room is hot and condition not really make a difference even in long time of running area is very vibrant for those who is first time in singapore or this area please do not get food or things around hotel they are over pricing just a few steps away bugis vuillage and albert court you can have the same fruits and food but more decent and better price
1193,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,perfect place for a pleasant stay very near to little india we had a nice time there well maintained place staffs very friendly kind and helping breakfast was so awesome we liked it very healthy swimming pool was really good with jim by the side fantastic place for couples to stay

1195,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,overall a good budget hotel the hotel rooms are tiny ones but if you are here for sight seeing it does not really matter the hotel staff is courteous and helpfulthe breakfast was quite predictable and repetitive every alternate daybut the good part was upon request they prepared one plate of jain food almost everyday little india is min walk from the hotel for indian food overall a good budget hotel while on travel
1196,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,convenient point convenient hotel to stay walking distance from the rochor mrt station la salle college of arts bugis street and the best part a wide variety of food available around the same stretch of road clean and thumbs up for the air circulation in the room
1197,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,mr prashant kadam india we reached hotel quite early at around am on our request for an early checkin the front desk staff esp afakaffil serene scrolled through their checklist n got a room ready by amthe concern shown by the staff is highly appreciated this is my second visit to parc excellent locationneat n clean roomsreal value for moneywe are a family of three n the room i booked was spacious considering singapore standardsmany indian restaurant around
1198,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,value for money and great location stayed at this hotel on the st week of may on a family vacation reached there early and asked for an early checkin and was allotted our room within min of waiting the front desk was extremely courteous and and answered all our queries with a pleasant smile the room was small but functional we did not spend a lot of time in our room the superior room so was okay cleaning staff did a good job the restaurant was great to say the least food was very good and decent quality the location is great very close to bugis and little india overall a good experience only concern was the size of the room
1199,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,small room space double standard behaviour of duty manager stayed at standard room small room size if you place your luggage on floor next to walkway no space to walk toilet are too narrow and not good fit to use the bathroom towel had some many holes and i asked to replace i could see that most of customer from asia region who stayed in hotel the duty managerbold head behavior was observed that double standard for westerner and asian people example he was welcomed to western people and neither even a smile nor welcome for asian people
1200,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,great place very central we came on a holiday to singapore from sri lanka and we stayed for days and nights and we got connecting rooms and even though the room was a bit cramped up we enjoyed our stay the breakfast was lovely although the spread was limited and we would have liked it if there was a bit more variety the swimming pool was fantastic and the staff was very friendly and very helpful always working with a smile
1201,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,thums up worth it i stayed in this hotel on may and the hotel is centrally located rooms are clean the staffs are very friendly specially kaffil natasha peter and samsudin its very near to rochor and little india mrts as well
1202,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,nice place it was a good hotel with small room but maintained accessible and a lot of transport nearby lots of eatiries everywhere great service and friendly people food is ok but i wish they have diffrent food everyday still thumbs up to all
1203,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,shabby the lobby is very nice only thing is very small not many chairs to sit down room was very nice not much room to put your cases the corridors need painting the carpets in the corridors need replacing all stained good location needs a good refurbishing
1204,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,a lovely and enjoyable place to stay we stayed at this hotel last march and it was fantastic we were not disappointed room was small but at least clean everywhere you want to go was so easy as it was few steps to the rochor train the staffs made our stay just perfect the thing we least liked about this hotel is the rooms are not soundproof and we can hear some guest i think they are chinese people talking along the corridor even in the middle of the night hopefully your management can do something about it you may put a signage along your corridors like please keep silence or something anyway it was still a good stay
1205,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,my first hand experience cozy clean rooms and hotel excellent staff and crew strategically plan location very good relaxing area at swimming pool food are just average with bellhop services with available tour desk reasonable price
1206,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,customer service oriented hotel stay in march with my family we were very happy with the experience this hotel have provided it was a very friendly environment everyone at the front desk and lobby staff were all approachable and always ready to serve rooms are quite small to be considered as a star hotel category i may say it may be a very good star hotel instead location wise was definitely a perfect so close to bugis and so very accessible in most of the tourist destination in the lion city as hospitality worker i was satisfied with the experience the manager i may say made a good job training these people i would love to come back here few comments that may help to improve the service swimming pool operating hours is am to pm am is quite late and pm is quite early better grooming
1207,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,value for money this hotel is situated in close proximity to train station and tekka food court makes it a convenient location the staff was very helpful we had our late flight and the hotel allowed us to use the luggage storage and let us use the pool until pm the rooms was little smaller around square meters for someone who is transit in singapore this hotel provide value for money
1208,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,great service stayed at this hotel for night after a day cruise we arrived early but were greeted by the receptionists who even though we were early gave all of us an upgrade to a superior room to prevent us waiting i must at this point thank ck doris sharlene haleema and nurul for their assistance in not only sorting the rooms but also liaising with the taxi firm to amend our transfer times after a reasonable breakfast with a large choice we were again given excellent service this time by fil serene and ryan who kindly extended our check out time i can not fault the excellent device by the staff the only nigel was the size of the rooms which are small but the staffs attention to customer service made up for the disappointment of the rooms well worth a stay
1209,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,singapore family tour the staff at the parc sovereing hotel albert st is friendly and helpful the breakfast at the restaurant is really good and enjoyable the superior double room is neat and clean only issue is that the superior double room is not big enough by its width room is packed after we put our baggage the hotel is close to both rochor mrt station and the mustafa center
1210,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,1,diety room arrived in the evening and stayed only one night but found out at about pm that under my bed were lots of hair and dust which i think it was not clean for at least days called the receptionist and got a hk staff to clean she was having a nice gesture of offering room change but the kids were about to sleep there were also dust on the top of tv which i also showed the staff the management should look into this small detail for improvement the next day i requested to meet a manager to simply give some feedback but i was told the manager is not around today
1211,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,superp we stayed at the hotel for days and from the moment we checkedin to checkedout the whole hotel crew was at our service we were provided with an excellent service right through out we had a year old daughter with us for whose breakfast we were supposed to pay additionally however ms haleema at the front desk made arrangements to provide that for free of charge very flexible and reliable staff with a high level of hospitality we wont think twice to choose this hotel for our next trip too special thanks goes to ms haleema the girl with beautiful big eyes
1212,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,service in a hotel we had a long flight from our home to singaporewe were very angry with our travel agency as they promise that we can can check in early at am when the reception explained that check in is pmreception was very nice and gave us early check in at noon with no charge staff at counter are very polite and helpful i still remember we one of the nightwhen my husband bring three mobile phone to ask help for wifi internet problemhe mentioned a chinese man named mr peterwas very patientnice and helpful when helping him but a big thank you for thai staffmr kaffilhe planing us the best place to go in singaporehe make our family confidently explore singapore with clear instructionsbut sadly on our last short tripmy husband was dissapointed we didnt get to thank him in
1213,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,ok hotel in overpriced city our stay here did not start wellwe arrived around midnight very tired from our flightwe booked a double room but were given a twin which would have been fine had they told us but instead we went to the th floor with our bags only to then have to come back to reception to find out that there were no doubles available due to maintenance hence why they had given us the twin roomthat would have been absolutely fine had they told us at checkin but they didntthey offered to send us to another hotel for one night and then bring us back once the room was sorted however we had to pay the taxi and then claim it back we chose to stay in the twin rather than move hotelsnot at any point was there an apology or anythingrooms were ok but very smallid

1216,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,good location to catch metro and roam in singapore we booked a standard room and it is a bit small not so spacious there is enough space for walking in the room after double cot bed is placed thats itswimming pool in the hotel is very smalllocation of the hotel is goodthere is a metro nearby which can be reached in around mins of walkcatch the metro and then roam around singapore one more advantage with the hotel location is it is nearby area in which lots of indian restaurants are present so we dont miss indian food being a vegetarian it was important for me
1217,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,good customer service thank you parc sovereign hotel for the wonderful stay big thumbs up to the staff mrkaffil a very humble and helpful person thank you to the other staff and crews also will come again with my friends for a short trip to singapore

1219,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,so far so good no complain and hotel was simple and yet descent walking distance to shopping area lots of foods everywhere people are accommodating they have a swimming pool thats nice hang out the place is near to train station
1220,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,good experience singapore experience was good we explore marina bay sands garden by the bay the light show merlion park singapore flyer sentosa universal studio bugis singapore zoo and river safari all was worth visiting hoel location was accessible staff were friendly but unfortunately rooms were tiny but it was still good overall experience
1221,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,basic hotel with small rooms and no communal areas we were shocked when we arrived at this hotel after a long flight and found that there were only two small sofas in the reception area where everyone waiting for a room had to sitor stand when we saw our room and its basic nature this was an upgraded room we were amazed as we were expecting a star hotel room not a or star roomwe were booked in again with no possibility of cancellation for our return to singapore but reserved a room at a nearby hotel as we couldnt contemplate returning to this hotel
1222,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,4,customer friendly really pleased with the service of this hotel mr peter who was at the reception was so helpfull despite early checking in rooms were quite comfortable the food was exceptional hoping to visit the again
1223,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,very small room arrived today from kuala lumpur just overnight thank goodness the room is very small even worse my daughter and husband have two children and have been given a double bed and a single bed the two girls are thirteen and nine and will find it very hard too fit i must say the reception staff are excellent i am hoping they have a solution of how to fit four people on those beds its even impossible to move around the room after coming from kl and kota kinabuli where the rooms are huge i think perhaps we have been spoilt the location is great near the rail and little india
1224,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,average mid range hotel stayed as part of package prior to cruise hotel is in a great location for getting around on underground and walking near by however room was very small with very little space to hang store clothes roof side pool was pleasant to swim in and nice to have outside space to sit it did close very early which was a shame stayed on fifth floor it was extremely noisy through the night mainly from other guests who insisted on banging doors at am room door did not fit flush with the floor which meant the light was bright into the room i would not chose to stay here again
1225,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,3,short break we had booked a cruise and our travel agent had booked this hotel for a night stay the hotel was sited well in the city it was in walking distance of china town and little india the hotel was ideal for a short stay although the bedroom were quite small it was adequate for the duration dont expect a fantastic view because the rooms are over looked by a housing block nevertheless it was a pleasant stay therethe staff were very helpful and friendly the swimming pool although small was situated on the hotel roof but was nice to chill round during the heat of the day we did not eat at the hotel because being near china town there are plenty of culinary delights all in all if you are stopping off after a long flight or having a long weekend break then the hotel is
1226,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,2,good location but thats about it location is great rochor tube station is in front of the hotel and bugis direct line with changi airport and little india are only min walking distance this means you get to the airport in arounf min and to chinatown the clarke quay or marina bay in min bugis junction shopping mall is also around min walking distance if you wish to do some shopping and it has a very nice dinning area reception staff and bellboys are very nice however floor staff is quite deplorable in my experience a maid was making a room near mine at midnight and was banging around everything when i confronted her her answer was oh are you sleeping of course not what would i be in my room otherwise right breakfast buffet cost around but the choice is quite poor toast some
1227,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,conviniently located hotel the hotel is conveniently located it is just a few steps from the rochor mrt station going to marina bay sands you may alight at bay front and presto you are at marina bay and gardens by the bay already it is also near burgeese market and limlim electronics center nice hotel good service and strategically located
1228,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,lovely stay spent two nights here on our way back to the dubai from philippines and wish we could have stayed longer yes it was expensive but so worth it staff were all very friendly and helpful was given a late check out to pm as we had an evening flight for no extra charge which was greatly appreciated bed was very comfortable too which is always a bonus wouldnt hesitate to stay again should we visit singapore in the future
1229,Ibis Styles Singapore Albert Singapore,5,parc sovereign hotel the hotel is minutes away from the airport and the location was is near to bugis market its a few minute walk to rochor mrt and little india its also close to sim lim square theres a nearby catholic church from the hotel which is saint joseph church the hotel is accessible to city area it was a satisfying accommodation friendly staff and a descent hotel to stay
1230,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,a very good stopover on our trip we stayed here on our trip to grand prix it was a very comfortable hotel clean tidy and good facilities swimming pool was very nice and obviously warm with the temperature being what it was we had excellent service from the duty manager and a charming member of the housekeeping team who had just become a father and was so so happy it was quite infectious would be very happy to stay here again
1231,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good price with acceptable service nice hotel with friendly staffs breakfast was good and plenty of choices love breakfast restaurant over looking to the pool room was good and clean improvements point is we booked double bed two room but once arrival the reception inform there is not double bed available and we need wait them mn to get new with double bed ac in the room are working until we call the reception to get maintenance to fixed
1232,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,awesome room upgrade and breakfast it was a special occasion as it was my in laws first visit to singapore and their anniversary i was checked in by jermaine who could not have been more helpful upon hearing of the reason for the trio he immediately upgraded the room which made the whole trip as it had a lounge area we could spend time together in the breakfast was also spectacular had a wide range of western and asian style dishes and so something for everyone outside is a few restaurants and a eleven which is also extremely handy many thanks to the great team at mercure for wonderful memories
1233,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,new and central nice hotel new cleanthey have shuttles to orchard road good value for money prompt servicesquick check in and out very professional will stay here again the breakfast is a little so so they have a eleven store just adjoining so its easier to access we loved the stay here beds were comfortable though rooms were very small
1234,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,great location and facilities but a few service issues took the shine off my first stay here for nights started well with efficient checkin and i was pleased with the room being compact but well designed very clean with a comfortable large bed marked double but to australians it is queen sized the location is in an attractive neighbourhood within walking distance of stevens metro station or orchard road but i also found the buses which stop right outside very convenient for getting around especially the which went not only to orchard road but also to clarke quaychinatown having pools shared between the mercure and novotel is great and i enjoyed relaxing here it seems they are still finding their feet after the covid period and there were a few letdowns firstly the shower was not hot this was attended to fairly promptly when i reported the problem but even then needed to be run for a long while to get up to temperature not exactly environmentally friendly wasting a lot of water unnecessarily on day i returned to find that when theyd serviced my room theyd disposed of my personal toiletries deodorant aftershave hair gel as well as the hotelprovided shampoosoaptoothbrushtoothpasteslippers ive never had this happen before at any hotel and can only assume they got their wires crossed and assumed the room was to be made ready for a new guest and only after theyd disposed of the items realised my clothes were hanging in the wardrobe and that i hadnt actually checked out there was no welcome treat in the room for my gold all loyalty nor room upgrade i do think the hotel was fairly heavily booked so maybe not available upon asking i was offered a late checkout on my final day so that did make up for the other service failures somewhat finally over a week later im still waiting to receive my all points it is annoying having to chase these up when other hotels are able to credit them promptly almost as soon as checkout has been completed id certainly consider staying here again hopefully these issues are due to shortstaffing andor a large proportion of staff being new and hopefully on future stays they will have all these sorted
1235,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,the slowly decline of two once great hotels i stayed several times in the mercure and novotel on stevens but its not a good hotel anymore check in was very chaotic rooms are still okay but need to be looked after a bit better breakfast is ridiculous compared to what it once was very limited choice mediocre quality l would say choice cut by really sad biggest disappointment they even do not have a lounge anymore that can be used by accor platinum members what you get is a free drink at the bar thats it the main benefits are not available anymore a good breakfast and having a lounge the two pools are still nice but i am not sure about hygiene given the not really great location and the obvious slowly decline i will think twice before going there again
1236,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,pleasant stay the checkin process was smooth and fuss free counter staff was courteous and polite was issued a room situated at a high floor nd highest floor but there wasnt much of a view as we were facing the condo across the road the room was of decent size and basic amenities were provided however the disposable slippers were left out so we had to request from the housekeeper separately toilet was also of decent size and relatively clean overall had a pleasant sleep and will return if the price is good
1237,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,unrivalled customer service from the moment i entered the lobby to drop off my bags before checking in to the last taxi to take me to the airport it was an amazing experience all around michelle at the front of house team was incredible i was acknowledged by name everytime i departed and returned michelle provided amazing recommendations and would even follow up on the experiences the following day the customer service provided by all staff was unmatched by the other places i had visited in singapore
1238,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,kudos had a superb experience thanks to michelle who is very warm and professional attended all our queries and her suggestions were terrific to the likes of us travelers thanks michelle breakfast selection was good swimming pool is cozy with a great view
1239,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,bad experience my staying for nights was terrible on the first day of check in i was given a q number but i keep on waiting and saw some guys just walk into the counter to check in and no one attended to the q waited for an hour before i start asking how come my q was not call then someone just said you can go to the next counter if thats the case whats the point having q number and my room was not clean up for my entire stay even the last night i called the receptionoperator that im going out and please arrange a house keeping on my room and thats was at pm when i back at midnight the house keeping tag still hanging outside the door and the room was not cleared imagine we use old towel for the nights and rubbish bin totally full and smelly as for breakfast we only enjoy the day breakfast as there isnt crowd control no one bother to give us a table as a lots of table were full of plates im not sure why singapore standard drop so much and as your sliver and loyal member this is the first time i had such experiences its suppose to be a staycation for me to relax ended it worst than my own house
1240,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,poor service no room cleaning online check in is totally useless we arrived at the hotel at am from airport have to do same check in process and was given a room with faulty door the room door cannot be closed so we called operator who said someone will come to check wait for sometime no one came as we are tired so we came down to reception and asked for room replacement now already am the young reception didnot know what to do have to wait for his senior then again have to wait standing at reception for quite some time until i got new room and move our lugage to new room after all settled already am then we ask for room cleaning wait for days no one clean the room call operator who said she will input the request to system to clean next morning wait again no one clean again report to
1241,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,nightmare probably the worst hotel ive stayed at with accor as a diamond member ive stayed in quite a few if you want to queue for minutes to check in wait an hour for breakfast to see huge cockroaches in the laundry room i did tell the manager and he didnt seem to care use elevators without lights the only lights were out then this is the hotel to check into ive just canceled my reservation for my next trip and staying somewhere else
1242,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,do not stay here for a while awful experience here is the list minutes to check in that was only due to the fact i stood at the back office door to demand a check in when i was given room keys the room wasnt even made up and secondly i was given room keys for someone else room that was still occupied we asked the reception to place the other keys under the door as we had to leave this wasnt done none of the rooms were serviced during the whole days air conditioning was not working in one of the rooms during the whole stay one of the doors locked itself and couldnt be unlocked for hours check out was also two hours none of my platinum priveleges were recongised just do not stay here for a few months the excuse that we were given was that the hotel has just reopened
1243,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,very disorganised waited hours plus for the check in which caused us to missed our very important meeting no special lane for member either breakfast have to que for hour for seats which we eventually had to skip could have managed better if the hotel anticipate influx of guest arrival
1244,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,covid isolation toilet wasnt really that spacious hard to move around in the toilet and there is no place to hang the clothes the water pressure was kind of small too it need twice to thrice to actually flushes
1245,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good hotel in desirable area room i was in a large enough size room but not particularly spacious the bathroom however was lovely complimentary minifridge and nespresso made a big difference room service was prompt if not a little overpriced given how affordable singaporean food can be this was to be expected given it being an international hotel chain location it was a fair walk to the nearest mrt and quite a walk in the opposite direction to the shopping district orchard the area itself is obviously very affluent and it was nice to experience a little of that side of singapore amenities there were two swimming pools one an infinity pool and a gym available check in was swift the staff very polite and professional the only confusing thing is that there are two hotels located on the
1246,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice and pleasant to situated at a comfortable location the hotel is nice and the staff are very helpful it has its own restaurant and an indian restaurant adjacent to itthe room was neat and tidy but a little cramped with the furniture overall nice stay enjoyed it
1247,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,typical accor so dont expect sensational when i was went to the new mercure singapore on stevens during valentines day i honestly wasnt expecting the hotel grounds to be this huge the building includes the novotel singapore on stevens next door as well as a couple of restaurants bars in the lower level there is not just one but swimming pools nestled in this building as well as a tennis court fitness centre the gym is fairly wellequipped whos to say you cant enjoy a good workout whilst on a staycation when you need to replenish head downstairs to fudebar for their nicely toasted panini exclusive bottled beers the property is located a few minutes away from orchard road if youre worried about accessibility may be glad to know the hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to orchard road
1248,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,checkingin here is pain in the ass it took me more or less minutes to check in and it was late night so it was just me the girl in the reception was too slow to find my booking showing all the confirmation and receipts from hotelscom that it was paid and still hesitant to check me inbefore that i even make a call to the hotel and was answered by her to confirmed if they got my reservation or not and they even confirmed that they have it and its all paid so when i got there i was disappointed because she was asking for money for to check in even if its all paid and i got a receipt so i call the hotelcom customer service to follow up my booking and she did apologise that she havent seen it breakfast is terrible its messy and disoriented at oclock theyre buffet is empty and got nothing
1249,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,pampered comfort i stayed nights and through out my stsy i was pampered my accomodation was comfortable and the bed just right but what really made my stay was the excellent staff i woukd be remiss if i didnt mention that even with the entire staff being top notch one person stood out as having exceeded to go beyond dahlia the guest service executive in the premier lounge made me feel so welcome and spoilt every evening that i entered the lounge well done mecure well done
1250,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,dinner at winestone we shared the seared scallops for appetiser had the pan seared cod as my main and creme catalana for dessert the hubby had the ragout tagliatelle and panna cotta the service was great and we love the ambience as much as the food
1251,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,poor fb service let me start off with the positives the amenities such as the pool gym are nice mr damien reception and mr ashok concierge were amazing and made our stay better on the other hand the attitude displayed by the fb team was unacceptable i saw a number of them snap at various guests for minute things the quality of the food itself matches the price you pay but the rooms are too small unless you travel alone if possible id suggest paying a bit more and enjoying yourself at the novotel singapore on stevens
1252,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice stay one more time is booked a room at mercure hotel as an accor platinum member i could use the novotel lounge in the same building the shuttle bus from the hotel to orchard road is convenient im looking forward to be a guest at this hotel soon again
1253,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,marvellous mercure stayed for a business trip and would stay again the rooms are a bit small but spotless the breakfast was delicious and the staff are fantastic there are a few places to eat just outside the door including a fantastic italian place not on orchard road but you can easily walk there

1257,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,budget friendly good location budget friendly hotel only problem with the room size they are so tiny this hotel is sharing grounds with novotel at stevens the hotel ground has other restaurants and coffeehouses they also has a eleven located just meters from reception
1258,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,best hotel to stay in singapore mercure singapore on stevens was an amazing place to stay the customer service was exceptional i spent a week at the hotel with my partner for our anniversary and all requests that we asked for were granted with great service from the lovely staff at both mercure and novotel on stephens the hotels modern rooms range of restaurants pool and gym anemeties as well as the shuttle bus service made our stay in singapore extra special and i would definitely recommend booking a room at mercure on stephens for your trip to singapore
1259,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,affordable comfort stayed here for one night for a work trip in november pleasant stay in general walking distance to orchard road comfortable rooms with enjoyable amenities any hotel with an iron and ironing board is a win win for me unsure about the halal ness of the hotels buffet cause i didnt need to have it therefore muslim travelers will need to clarify that perhaps first prior to booking unless its not necessary as part of the trip experience
1260,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hotel with great service i stayed here for two nights during transit i booked for standard room in which it is good enough for one person the hotel itself is just two years old pretty great facilities with all the necessary amenities situated just two stop from orchard if you are taking public buses or you may rely on their shuttle in which it runs on hourly basis the complimentary breakfast is pretty good in conclusion for standard room it is great for one or two persons max however if you are bringing kids due to the room space you may need to consider novotel on stevens literally just next building i was also told that you can have your breakfast at novotel with additional sgd they have more variety and there are also choice of freshly cooked foods definitely something to try on
1261,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,mercury on stevans holiday stay mercury on stevans was an absolute delight to stay in the room was well provided with all the necessary ammenities every single need was met from your toiletries to your personal need there was even a shoe shine the hairdryer was very powerful you dont need to carry anything extra they had bathrobes too linen was spotless they are big on sustainability and so they ask if you need the linen changed everyday if you dont then the laundry money is spent on sustainability they do make your room everyday acs are in excellent condition great stay and great memories the free shuttle is prompt and that makes it easy to commute to orchad road from where you take transport to any destination will definitely visit again and would recommend to anyone
1262,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,the hospitality of the front seat and concierge i am a tour manager thomas cook india limited we have been using this property from past few months and trust me its a amazing hotel the staff here is very friendly and helpful whenever theres a need mraloysious at front desk and mramir khan from concierge department were really helpful during my stay here thank you so much for all your services

1266,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,christmas week what a great value offering we had over christmas whether this is because its only new and gaining market share or whether it will always be like this who knows but we found excellent value and service from this hotel from the room rate itself to the very extensive breakfast buffet to the onsite laundry facilities to the foyer fudebar for convenience items to the store just seconds walk from the foyer along with all the other food and beverage offerings on this same site hyper convenient the hotel has a free shuttle which also picks up from a set location even the toothbrushes were excellent im keeping mine theyre doing the small things expertly the staff are very efficient and you only need to sit in the lobby for mins to see that where you

1270,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,clean and convenient its a clean and convenient hotel with clean room good neighbourhood basically just one bus stop away from orchard road minuts walkalso free schotel to orchard roadanyway i didnt use itdays bus and train tourist pass is singapore dollar plus s deposit self service laundry facilities is in placetwo pools and two restaurants too very polite and helpful front desk staff they accept late check out free mini bar was offered to me for all days of my stay because a little mistake from hotel the only downsiderooms and lobby is very small but i believe its reflected on the prices
1271,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,delightful staycation even though i had to wait for my room upon arrival the team member named dash made the wait seamless thank you for extending the minibar during my stay during the stay i came across two female team members who impressed me with their professionalism one of them was dolyn who initiated a conversation despite managing the front desk alone the other was mira who recognised me and struck a conversation while i was having a cigarette the three team members deserve a recognition as they sincerely made my short staycation a memorable one kudos to the management for having these awesome ladies
1272,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,shirley an amazing and memorable stay glad we booked with mercure singapore on stevens not an ounce of regret excellent customer service from front office to housekeeping from free shuttle bus to and from orchard swimming pools esp the infinity pool as well as breakfast makes our stay very enjoyable there is even a money exchange automated machine at the lobby for foreigners to convert cash to sgd if needed super convenient will stay here again without hesitation
1273,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hotel friendly staff neatly organized lounge and rooms had laundromat fitness center and swimming pools breakfast served by the hotel was of decent quality would visit again if i go back to singapore amazing experience overall
1274,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,week long visit back to singapore mercure is a gem of a place its not just the location which is ideal for access to orchard and the botanical gardens and the mrt its not just the facilities which i love including the two pools one lap and one infinity its about the genuine and authentic service from laura in housekeeping who topped up my complementary mini bar to asim at the breakfast buffet who always found me a table far from the madding crowds and its also the late night requests like the ice bucket and shot glasses for an impromptu party this place has me coming back again and again
1275,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,perfect location plus dining options this hotel is bang for the buck the room is nice clean and it is mins away by taxi from orchard road whats even better is that they have a free shuttle to and from the hotel to the dfs galleria on orchard they have a flat screen tv wifi a luggage caddy a safe a dental kit shampoo soap and conditioner they just dont have any mouthwash the room is clean and the bed is clean i have dust mite allergies and if my eyes puff out the next day that means that they dont vacuum the bed and the pillows and the pillows are old
1276,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,not friendly and accomodative we stayed for days but got charged for even though i had informed about late check in and late check out in advance got charged for minibar without using the facilities the breakfast also poor quality staff not ready to listen and rude
1277,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,novotel mercure lounge due to length of stay over days offered complimentary lounge entry great spot with top friendly team trainee li wenjin anna was interesting to talk to and keen to promote accor image and services nice to meet a keen and positive younger person in the workforce
1278,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,best for short transit and business trip basic amenities small room but clever use of space room is not entirely soundproof i could hear what the neighbours are doing bed is cozy but very small location wise a stone throw away from orchard mrt theres shuttle service from hotel to orchard mrt as place is also nestled in the residential area you get the quiet ambience all around cafe food and price at the lobby is overpriced tried their coffee wasnt great wasnt bad either
1279,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,best value hotel i booked the hotel at the last minute the room rate was very reasonable as compared to other hotels int the area i didnt know what to expect since i had never stayed there before my flight arrived early in the morning in singapore after a long journey front desk staff went above and beyond to find me an available room even though the standard check in time is pm the room was perfectly sized for a solo traveler and it was spotless with a great view hotel is not within walking distance to orchard road but they provide continuous free shuttle services to there for the hotel guests the property is new also is connected to novotel my room rate included breakfast buffet bf had a large selection of the western and asian foods all in all i cant say enough good
1280,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,hotel room too small first time we stayed at mercure hotel and we thought that the room should be spacious like novotel on stevens as we stayed there before however when we opened the room oh nosuper small room size and no king size bed too not suitable for family and more suitable for business traveller or couple only overall great customer service and they offer free minibar thank you so much
1281,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,fabulous service by anna li dahlia and chef ismail i am writing in response to some of the best service i have ever been provided with at the hotel having stayed at mercure and novotel on stevens previously this was not my first time in the executive lounge always enjoying the manner in which staff greet guests this experience was a step above anna impressed me not once but thrice with her warmth and great attention to detail from her first hello anna was winsome and a joy to interact with her conversational skills kept me in the lounge longer than i planned on staying as we enjoyed the company sharing freely i was amazed to discover she only has months of experience with accor as she exudes the professionalism of a long experienced staff she is a definite must keep once her internship ends as she brings great
1282,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,thanks to the very good hotel in singapore and thanks to mrash when i checked in mrash the duty manager knew what we needed my mom is really happy when she knew the room is upgraded and very clean one and a quite room thank you very much mrashyou are such a very helpfull person and also to the hospitality and kind of mercure and novotel employeeslike mssyamiramrsayedsuch a very good management by mrash we really happy to stay there also for the location is near orchardi really want to stay again
1283,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great experience from check in to check out the mercure singapore stevens is the first hotel i have experienced when a member of its staff contact the guest to find out about his needs during his stay even before he steps into the hotel i would like to extend a big thank you to its hardworking premier lounge manager thereafter everything is well taken care of from check in to the quality of the room to check out
1284,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,bad experience in reservation any one booked this hotel unless the price is below market and you and your family can accept non walkable distance from public transport or fine with shuttle service i booked the room for nights through a hotel reservation platform at my first sight i saw it was with free cancellation silly me when i completed the booking i found that it was non refundable i emailed the reservation team at once but i must follow the cancellation policy i offered to stay one night instead of nights but in vain if i am travelling alone i think i am fine proposing alternatives as i am travelling with kids so if you are looking for a convenient location please reconsider
1285,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good sized rooms in the suburbs this hotel has a shuttle to orchard rd it is not walkable unless you are particularly fit and enjoy humidity and being physically uncomfortable for the most part you will need to cab or grab to anywhere outside the hotel the staff are helpful and accomodating the rooms are large by singapore standards in this price mark
1286,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,exceptional experience due to exceptional team checked in for nights as accor gold on my second stay and received a surprise enhancement on my booking guest of the day it was a touching gesture on the part of dashenti krishnakumar at the front desk as the perfect room she arranged for my stay was still being prepared went up to the premier lounge to wait for the room and sho khamsani of the lounge guest experience started the moment warmly by delivering a drink before commencing the check in formalities he was thorough in explaining the breakfast and happy hour lounge timings and options it is often the team that makes hotel stay exceptional and it is due to them that my stay is off to a great start i will say that their attentive and accommodating approach really sets mercure on stevens apart from the
1287,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,noisy nights i was woken up on several nights at or in the morning by people in the corridors or on other floors i found it very noisy also my non smoking room smelled of stale cigarette smoke i could put up with it but it was unpleasant the room itself was clean it just smelled bad
1288,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,comfortable stay convenient location spent days exploring singapore and visit exhibition once again the hotel checkin time is pm the mercure hotel chain was very central middle range price and convenient to all minimum offers include free wifi daily buffet breakfast at winstone minutes to orchard road with free shuttle bus service everything in wellcompact with all the necessary functionalities into space
1289,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,perfect overnight stopover i was welcomed by dash on reception and she was wonderful polite professional friendly and accommodating could not ask for a better ambassador for the hotel the room was relatively small nothing glamorous but perfect for what i needed to get some sleep in a bed between long haul flights breakfast was excellent selection of local and european only thing missing was a hotel room guide describing the hotel features
1290,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,birthday staycation i planned a surprise staycation for my husband to celebrate his birthday instead the hotel surprised us by selecting us to be the guest of the day i was told they will select a guest upgrade and let the guest enjoy the perks in the hotel it was definitely our lucky day we both had an awesome stay thanks to dashanthi who welcomed us with a charming smile already felt the warmth at the reception then we were brought to the executive lounge for checkin a must mention is dahlia at the executive lounge who always went out of her way to make us happy she even made arrangement for a special birthday cake for my husband a memorable staycation with wonderful service all thanks to mercure team checkin on nov and out on dec kavitha parthiban
1291,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,a short but memorable stay was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suite however the checkin process was strange as we had to go to lounge in novotel and get checkedin checkin was pleasantly done by ash and rueben at the lounge very warm and welcoming then we had to go back down to nd floor to go to mercure side of the hotel to go to our suite the suite was nice the sofa bed comes in handy size wise is as expected from mercure branding small but not too small bed was very comfortable as well the shuttle bus to the scottsorchard area was ideal for us to have dinner and walk around breakfast at the coffee house has wide variety and food was tasteful checkout was a breeze and all staff that we have encountered was very warm and friendly kudos to the manager pong and his team
1292,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,very nice experience great hotel nice designed and equipped room professional an nice staff especially premier lounge crew mrs dahlia mrs anna and mr sho have made our stay special welcoming us warmly and kindly every evening with delicious food and prosecco breakfast in winestone with all whats needed also with local dishes like laksa good value for money
1293,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great value for money and accessible location i stayed at mercure late october and i was amazed by the beauty of the hotel its very modern and so many food options everywhere they also provide free shuttle service to orchard which is only minutes away all the staffs where professional specially the bell service who patiently and always friendly in attending each guest to get a taxi i will surely come back on my next trip to singapore
1294,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,about the room it is super tiny there isnt space for luggage and it was just me really tiny but it has all the necessary iron amenities kettle it was noisy in and out you could perfectly hear each move of the neighbors the walls in the bathroom were dirty food average quality but efficient staff if you need something and big and nice outdoor swimming pool
1295,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,not sure what the upgrade was staying at this hotel for the weekend and got upgraded to a privilege room upon check in not really sure what the upgrade was cause its still the same room size small and apparently we get no lounge access either lol nice pool and gym though
1296,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great amenities staff and location stayed one night here and was impressed by the high level of service nice sized gym two pools one of them a lap pool the room was clean and the staff pleasant and helpful theres also a free shuttle bus to orchard shopping district
1297,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,layover in singapore i was staying for night in mercure and enjoyed my time there room size is a bit small but bed is very comfortable i could recommend to add conditioner and body lotion to amenities staff is friendly and ready to help but unfortunately no one ask me to help with my suitcase when i was going to the room after check in overloaded with bags location a bit far from metro but still not so far from the city center by grab as for the breakfast variety was great european and asian options are available
1298,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,not the best checkin experience average hotel i arrived to the hotel at around h and i had previously requested to checkin at pm if possible when i arrived a young guy was quite polite and he said that my room was about to be ready and asked me to wait min after minutes waiting i asked the guy what was the status of the room and another girl in the front office responded to me in a very impolite and unprofessional manner that i should just wait well should they told me from the beginning that my room would be ready at i would just had left to the downtown and safe time instead they made me wait for an hour and with a disgusting attitude that lady shouldnt be working at the front office maybe in a place where she doesnt face clients as she is responsible for damaging the image and reputation
1299,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,despicable front office service i would resume my review pros new hotel cons cheap amenities awful food far from orchid and marina bay check in a nightmare arriving pm and no room available check out is the worst experience in my life traveling around the world have been in continents visit singapore often for business and lived there years never had a experience leaving me speechless at my check out i asked the front office guy helping me to clear my balance why the hotel give me a handicap room as a question due the room should be available for a person really needed and as well was uncomfortable for me and gave the example of the bathroom where i couldnt reach the shower properly as is a chair blocking me the access this would be convenient for a person in wheelchair but not a person
1300,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,ms peaceful day stay staff were very polite lovely breakfast and superb buffet dinner initially thought we might experience difficulties getting around however the hotel provided a shuttle buds every half hour there were frequent busses to a mrt station recommend this place
1301,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,leisure with husband its a very nice and good location with the very affordable price for the prime location with the shuttle bus service to scotts road every minutes interval its incredible convenience rooms very clean and must say complete ammenity n compliment mini bar soft drinktiger beer and water keep up the good work sure will return and stay again
1302,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,good value new hotel with nice gym and pool stayed at this hotel a couple times as its new and rate is good location is not far from orchard but not walking distance from mrt station they provide shuttle bus to dfs mall at scotts road there is also a nearby bus stop that takes you to orchard road if you can familiarize yourself with the bus routes nice gym and pool breakfast was just average for mercure standard the water pressure for the shower was too low took me much longer time to shower i would rate higher if they had fixed it next time
1303,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,just ok the location is near orchard road with shuttle service not exactly that convenient the room is small and there is no real view in its context it is new and modern staff try to be polite but not very professionally for example one staff said i will teach you how to use wifi on check in he could have said i will explain or show you it is not cheap i drove and the car parking system immediately deducted my card before i can even have time to pull out cashcard and paid plus when it should be complimentary i was not happy
1304,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,migraine sufferers beware good checkin room was smaller than expected lots of rooms per floor and mine was a bit of a walk from the elevator i guess that was a good thing since we didnt hear a lot of noise from the hall theres a luggage rack which is handy beds were comfortable there was a lounge chair with a small table no desk though coffee maker and kettle with coffee pods tea and all were available there was a safe which was handy there was also an ironing board and iron tv selection was great with movie channels cnn bbc etc the bathroom had shampoo conditioner soap toothbrushes etc hot water was abundant good breakfast buffet what i didnt like i didnt have room cleaned on the nd night the rd night i expected room to be cleaned and sheets changed sheets were not
1305,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,accor brings the a game another accor hotel and i am reminded why i have the accor club card the hotel was booked for me and i was not disappointed easy check in lovely sheets and toiletries spare shaving kit and other necessaries on hand the reception helpfully lent me a travel adapter the gym is well equipped and open with swipe card extensive breakfast bar respectful of a wide range of cultural preferences
1306,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,pools are lovely rooms are shoeboxes and service really not up to scratch i liked the pool areas at the hotel and also the gym but my room was the tiniest shoe box and i was given two beds so small that i nearly fell out of the bed three times and you couldnt move the twins together they seemed to be nailed to the floor so i must have hurt my head and body like times umping into everything in the room service was also really bad and unenthusiastic breakfast staff were particularly disappointing not at all what you expect in asia where you always expect more friendliness
1307,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good hospitality excellent hotel in general their employees were helpful to assist me when i was not that well a special thanks to the hotel manager and i appreciate all the help given as well facilities wise the hotel equipped with good facilities i also want to mention about their comfortable bed and room really recommended
1308,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,small but cosy decided this hotel as our wedding anniversary staycation hotel was nice to send a cake for this occasion room is small but clean bed is comfy and the best we appreciate is although room is small the sound proof is great we didnt hear sound of opening doors or people chatting despite the rooms were closely knitted breakfast spread was huge and crowded by am shuttle bus available to t galleria overall we had a relaxing stay
1309,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good compact hotel with nice shared facilities with novotel was given an upgrade to a room on the privilege floor unfortunately the privilege lounge is located in novotel which requires one to go down to the lobby and cross over the same applies for the gym and swimming pool room is compact and clean a compact bathroom attached the lounge is staffed with a group friendly service crew but their evening cocktail service can get a little crowded around the small service area perhaps the format could be changed to individual portion hors douevre instead so that everyone does not need to crowd around the counter breakfast at the lounge features a decent spread of food and drink options and is much more calm than any of the restaurants cocktails served at novotels bar are splendid
1310,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,good value but we stayed nights in a superior room with breakfast the hotel is located on stevens road which extends from scotts road less than km from bustling orchard the mrt is a long walk on either side but you can easily get singapores excellent public buses from bus stops very close by so public transportation is not really an issue at all they also had a free half hourly shuttle to orchard taxis as always are plentiful and grab is always available so really the quiet location is more boon than bane unless you are looking to be in a hotspot check in was quick and professional the superior room and bathroom were tiny although fairly well designed but seriously lacked closet space since we were traveling light it was fine but i can see people with bigger bags really
1311,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,definitely would stay again staff are courteous and friendly and helpfulcheck in was a bit slow rooms are small but neat amenities not topped up before checking people in eg no ironing board no kettle and no bathroom amenities but these are small details as they were quick to bring up close to shopping if you like to walk but public transport quick close the hotel also has a free shuttle to orchard road i would definitely stay again

1314,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,whirlwind hrs in singapore the mercure singapore on stevens was the perfect solution for a hr stay we arrived late in the evening and had only the following day to explore the city before flying out that evening the hotel is easy to access from the airport via taxi and a shuttle to orchard rd creates convenience the staff and in particular ashok concierge were very very helpful ashok was full of great tips for getting the most out of our day as well as accommodating us with arranging shower facilities and taxis at the end of the day to make our dash to the airport and flight home stress free we look forward to staying for longer next time and wouldnt hesitate to recommend the hotel as a cost effective yet comfortable stay
1315,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,attitude problem experience from weeks stays the hotel looks big classy and grand from the outside but hotel rooms are very tiny if youve plan to stay for more than nights better look for other choices or upgrade to bigger room options swimming pool looks nice but in fact dirty not well cleaned with moldy tiles after swim body will get itchy location not located in orchard center but near by and free shuttle service provided this is a good service public bus from orchard cost only only min of walking distance from hotel to shaw center reception depends on your luck some friendly with big smile but some poor attitude cleanliness this must be improve cleanliness is very important for a hotel cleaners attitude is very poor they just simply do their

1331,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,everything at your finger tips if your looking for a wonderful place to stay in singapore then the mercure on stevens is it i will be staying again whilst in singapore the checkin was easy the rooms are very clean and whilst they are small in footage the high ceilings and ceiling to floor windows make the rooms appear more spacious than they are excellent for tall people the restaurants and wine bar are a perfect place to have a beverage and a spot of dinner the pools are beautifully curated there is a free shuttle bus to orchard rd that runs each half hour from am the mercure and notovel flank one another but the concierge service keeps the taxis and transfers running smoothly basically an all around wonderful place to stay in the middle of singapore
1332,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,horrible stay stayed night here and it was the worst experience i ever had in singapore we fly in that the evening fully expecting to go straight to your room after a long day of travelling only to be told you have no room ready with many others waiting at the bar for our room
1333,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,disappointing stay at mercure on stevens this is goin to be very lengthly from start to finish of stay think the best service provided was from the shuttle servicepromptaccurateprecise upon checkin hostess at the counter werent very friendly didnt even bother to greet a simple welcome smiled monotonous face she didnt even know the amount tat were needed to be paid only after some correction n information from me after upon entering room floor toilet were slightly dusty well but still acceptable next days breakfast time at wine stone restaurant i wouldnt say that its very horrible food were mediocre all same food for days same rotation as if the chef has run out of ideas to serve or maybe just couldnt be bothered with any food rotations everyday missing condiments off the
1334,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,a relaxing stopover mercure singapore on stevens is a welcome oasis amid the hustle and bustle of singapore whilst located a short distance away from the main drag there is a free shuttle bus to busy orchard road the rooms are wellappointed and the bed and pillows are so comfortable that you drift off to sleep in no time i would love to take the pillows home with me
1335,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,clean room but synergy among staff needs a lot improvement room is clean more efforts required for the synergy among staff as there seems to be a lack of communication among staff of front desk to housekeeping as well as teamwork among staff of front desk to bellman
1336,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good place to stay good hotel friendly staff great choices for breakfast has leisure facilities but never used them as always out room was very clean and bath robes and slippers were provided nice touch mins walk to mrt stevens station

1339,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,conveniently placed and comfortable friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms the hotel is well placed in a quieter area of singapore but walking distance to the botanical gardens and orchard road breakfast is good we enjoyed our stay
1340,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,excellent stay centrally located close proximity to orchard road rooms were comfortable clean and new might feel the room was a bit too small if i had to stay for more than restaurants conveniently located at the entrance staff were friendly and helpful will definitely be back again
1341,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,a very good lodging for its price the hotel is in a new building same as the novotel the checkin process was quite fast which for me was very appreciated as i arrived well after midnight the room is rather small very functional clean but yes small there was a long armchair that i found to be the only place where i could open my large luggage without being on the middle of the floor the bathroom also was very limited in space but the shower box was very fine internet was fast and easy to connect the king size bed was very comfortable but covered with a extremely thick duvet after a while i felt hot even with the air conditioning at full blast which was inevitably noisy so i removed the quilt used only the sheet and lowered the air conditioning to the minimum and had a fine temperature and a
1342,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,need some works the hotel have a nice design and great location althought the superior room seem small and maybe the all the hotel here is the same but the setup in room is nice and well prepared first upon checkin the receptionist should make sure that the booking in details for every single details and no need to ask if my booking has breakfast included the second whenever make new room key receptionist should know that how many room key that they have issued to guest and how many time the keycard machine has been assigned this wont make any mistake to guest how many key they have issued we only received one room key and one elavator but they said we received it means they remind me for if we lost and actually we only got and she even dont have any smile on
1343,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,can be more professional when check into the hotel all the setup only for person when i book for persons so need to call housekeeping to provide another set i believe mercure can be more professional as a member of accor hope they can do sth diff
1344,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,smaller room this hotel is located near orchard road i really like the amenities of this hotel the swimming pool and the gym but the room was a bit smaller as to compare to orher mercure on steven was beside novotel singapore the hotel offers free shuttle going to the nearest subway station
1345,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,memorable stay here for honeymoon the only staff who was friendly and helpful is deon everyone is helpful but not as friendly as deon thanks for the yummy honeymoon welcome cake the best thing is this hotel provide shuttle bus to orchard rd every mins until pm easy to get a taxi such a pleasant stay thank you
1346,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice stay for short biz trip it was great experiences from the check in to check out process the fact that the hotel is conjunction with other hotel in the same group is very good we can use the same facilities the breakfast was nice in the nd floor
1347,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,overall pleasant stay i stayed at the mercure for nights whilst in singapore the service upon arrival and for the duration of my staff was great the room itself was a superior double room which was adequate if not on the smaller side of things but it was clean and did the job little pet peeves of mine is when hotels use towels or linens with rips in them and my room had both on both nights i assume my towel was washedreplaced just throw them out or repair them if its possible the hotel provides a free shuttle service to nearly sites which is extremely handy and i utilized this across both days all in all a good stay
1348,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,good hotel but over crowded too crowded of people they accepted the tour so every time have to wait at the lift for so long breakfast wasnt good at all not worth the money we have paid for prefer eat outside the room was good although not big but comfortable
1349,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good diverse offer on breakfest very comfy bed ive been here for two days for business purpuses everything according to my high expectations good breakfest with wide offer english indian chinese thai food you name it i also found the bed in my room really comfy
1350,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,not the best service in singapore i dont get my room as i expected i booked different rooms and maybe they dont have standards for whats in the room like my room dont have a bathrobe but the others have and the second room have the spoon to stir the coffee and mine is not on my second day after they cleaned up the room they dont give the clean towel for my room so i have to call the housekeeping to give the towel but they come and only give towel and i have to ask for another one as they provide the service the lady from the housekeeping gave the towel without saying anything or even a smile on their face maybe she is so tired thats why they forget to give the towel to my room and feel irritated when i ask for one and also i dont get the shower amenities and the floor mat the
1351,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good option for a quiet getaway locally this is my rd time staying my choice of hotel due to the quiet atmosphere just what i needed a good swim access to pools that is not crowded and opened till pm free wifi for me to do some work or netflix nice cozy hotel with alot of food delivery options overall will definitely return
1352,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good midscale hotel stayed here for a day the hotel is well located close to orchard the rooms are very small but have all the basic amenities and thus good for solo travelers some good eating places in the premises including an indian restaurant and a papparich nice hotel for the price at this location
1353,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,night stopover this is a very new modern hotel with great helpful staff and some great facilities like the two swimming pools but it has extremely small bedrooms that are not suitable for a couple especially if youre staying longer than one night the first night we were there my husband became ill and i can not fault the help and assistance we got from the staff in organising a doctors visit and a taxi to the surgery unfortunately on our second night he was in lots of pain and unable to sleep lying down this was made worse by the fact that apart from spending the night sitting up on a very uncomfortable small chair the rooms are not soundproof and the woman in the next room talked very loudly until after am next morning i requested a larger room but i was told apart from the
1354,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,awesome place in singapore for family stay we stayed days and nights in this hotel the location is superb very calm and quiet place no rush anywhere in hotel all the staffs in receptions cleaning ladies as well the staffs whom serving the breakfast was very polite ready to help and answer any queries we all enjoyed in the stay all the best to the staffs and hotel management and i will sure propose your hotel to my friends and family circle for their future singapore trip
1355,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,quiet location helpful staff i travelled from canada on business i lived in singapore before and was familiar with hotel location staff was very helpful particularly syed and dino in the restaurant area decent swimming pool rooms a bit small but clean and functional a positive experience overall
1356,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,wonderful staff quiet location special attention to dino and syed who went above and beyond to ensure a positive experience in breakfast room they were very supportive of a badly jetlagged guest swimming pool excellent and room comfortable
1357,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,awesome place to stay when on business stay for days and this was a great hotel good friendly staff awesome pools and very well equipped gym onsite the restaurant had super breakfast options and the staff was supper helpful for special order
1358,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,small and cramped rooms i can understand it is budget hotel but when put your leg down from the bed you expect floor not the bathroom door room is very cramped and small avoid specially at that price much better alternates are available amenities are very basic
1359,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,value for money by singapore standards clean comfortable room excellent service good ambience clean relaxing room and the bed is comfortable the hotel staff from check in till check out is well mannered attentive helpful with smiling faces even with lots of other guests checking in breakfast was good enough choices for western or asian palate location is good with free hotel shuttle bus to shopping mall orchard road and not too far from airport good ambience and beautiful infinity pool like the executive lounge good service with ample variety choice of food and drinks throughout the day definitely would recommend this hotel congratulations for your high quality of staff and good maintenanceof amenities and ambience
1360,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,business trip novotel has mecure hotel attached to it even though it doesnt say on the address which i stayed there lately i have been noticed in room there are amenities missing standards are not follow it is not the same as before when they open this hotel room is very small and just enough for one person with one luggage only bathroom is sometime clean sometimes smelly theres floor mat but not always there there were no soap dish for the soap not like before the soft tissue that mostly they placed with last sheets only shower gel and shampoo provided the rest like conditioner body lotion shaving kit are no longer in room coffee tea facilities provided but no spoon for my last visits pen note pad were provided initially but later stays no longer
1361,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,not the most pleasant stay we had separate bookings for a total of consecutive nights to make sure the front desk know that we wrote a note in our booking and even called hotel to confirm when we checked in every thing became a problem the front desk got my name wrong so they couldnt find my booking i had to remind them of my other booking else they would take it as im checking out after the first they logged my salutation as the opposite gender and did not amend even after seeing me in person they gave us husband and wife a twin room and we had to change to the next available double room on following day when we swop keys for the new room they forgot to link up our other booking again for the th time i had to stress about my other booking they made us stand at the lobby to wait
1362,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,comfortable and clean room not value for money stayed for night paid about for a superior double room excluding breakfast overall it was a comfortable stay but not value for money pros comfortable clean room big flat screen tv with good channels comfortable big cozy bed nice infinity pool that is kids friendly halal restaurant paparich good location with free shuttle to town cons front desk staff could have been warmer and friendlier towards guests the room is just nice for ppl if you just have another toddler with you it will already feel cramp small bathroom and there is no bathtub could not get an early check in and only manage to extend check out by mins i requested for hour staying guests who drive are only allowed free parking exit per day i thought common hotel
1363,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good location nice functional hotel with a good gym and some good restaurants too great location close to orchard road nice upmarket location everything was good except the rooms were really compact and not suitable for guests
1364,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice hotel location so so this is a new hotel located on stevens road about km from the main shopping centre orchard road checkin staff very efficient and friendly concierge similarly friendly and efficient however this hotel also caters to tourists from china and they appear in a swarm typically they do not believe in standing in line and often push their way in front of the queue disappointingly the front desk staff merely ignore this action and serve them firstuntil i kicked up a stink i believe this should be something hotel management needs to address urgently both from the queue barging guests and the front desk staff there is also a cafe next to reception but often no one seems to be working there you have to request for the hotel reception to get you someone to look
1365,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,first visit of extraordinary experience with warm welcoming and thoughtful services it was delightful to stay at your hotel all services and staffs were thoughtful and kind barely dissatisfied it was shame to stay for short term only for business trip because it prevented me from fully enjoying the facilities of your hotel i would love to come again for a personal trip next time to visit singapore and stay at mercure singapore on stevens would also like to recommend here to friends and family thank you for your services
1366,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,staycation the room is clean and spacious however the experience with the counter staff was not ideal prior to the visit we had emailed to request for one of us to check in rooms on behalf to their agreement we even requested for connecting rooms over the phone on the day itself we were told there were no connecting rooms and we waited for more than one hour until we got the room in addition the staff was not helpful and insisted that only one room can be given until another party is present the facilities were all nice except that the pool is slightly dirty the gym is ideal with sufficient equipments for workout the shuttle bus was a great addition as it offers convenience to us for travelling to and fro to orchard overall i may return for a visit only if the service
1367,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,cheap new and comfortable not the best location i stayed here because i got a very good deal through the accor website i paid about s i was only in singapore for one night i arrived from the airport by taxi for a budget hotel arrival is pretty impressive its a brandnew purposebuilt building and the carport is shared with the fancier and moreexpensive novotel the lobby is simple and cleanly designed with a cafe checkin was fast and efficient my room was very small but i was expecting this its a cheap hotel in singapore it wasnt as small as similarlypriced rooms ive stayed at in other hotels the furama city centre is the only place in that price range ive stayed at with a bigger room the room was new and very clean lighting was particularly lovely with lots of choices about
1368,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,mecure hotel was a letdown i have stayed at novotel mercure and ibis hotels in a number of cities in the asia pacific this hotel was a disappointment in a number of ways first was the narrower that usual passageway to our deluxe room on the th floor i felt as though i was on a cruise ship next was the shocker the tiny room we entered we had then to deal with a cramped toilet and shower area first impressions count and this was a letdown for sureit had the look and feel of an ibis hotel there was a wide choice of items at the buffet breakfast on both days however the food in general lacked taste the chefs had apparently not tasted the food because it lacked saltespecially the noodles and fried rice on day two i decided to have scrambled eggs but i found the preparation to be too
1369,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,thank you kelly lim for an excellent service i am writing to express our appreciation for the quality of service you offered to us mar of our stay at your hotel of us had a wonderful dn stay in your hotel we enjoyed excellent service from your front office and restaurant staffs of your hotelyou and your team whom we came in contact was attentive flexible friendly and courteous to us we love the modern hotel pool laundromat delicious buffet at food exchange winestone we are sure well be back thank you very much again for such outstanding service and see you soon your sincerely mak chen
1370,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,my birthday staycation the overall service is good they decorate my bed send me a cake this team is professional the overall guess experience is good they provide me early check in at pm after confirming my room decoration is ready the infinity pool is nice it is good to spend a quiet afternoon there the gym facility is new there are a few things to improve as well breakfast not so many choices food exchange counter manager communication skill needs to be improved
1371,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,rather disappointed it is my first time staying at mercure i always stay at novotel i only stayed for one night plus side fast check in staffs are friendly prompt clean bed clean room down side single beds are small i think its cm or cm bed wifi are automatically cur off when your phone is locked amenities are rather hidden or just not there couldnt even find shower cap the most annoying of all is that the tv somehow managed to make itself error every minutesi have to turn the tv on off every minutes tiring was expecting more of mercure but sleep quality was good
1372,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,tiny rooms although strategically located the biggest challenge is the size of the room you can not sit anywhere except on the bed which was also small even it was difficult to find space to change clothes except the room size no major issues you can get better rooms at similar location at similar price
1373,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,happy with stay and environment loved the hotel ambience and environment check in process was such a breeze and i got my room earlier than expected security was also great as you needed a card to get up to your respective floor theres also a papparich halal eatery just beside the hotel which was great if you have young children they have a spacious grass patch for them to run around and busk in the sun really enjoyed my stay and looking forward to come again
1374,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,excellent i stayed in this hotel for days may i very much liked this hotel and will stay there when back to singapore rooms are very clean all the staff in hotel is very kind and friendly they are ready to help you and solve any problem you have even though hotel was full you can always find free tables on breakfast choice of food on breakfast was very large and everything delicious location is very good min walk to metro i am very much satisfied
1375,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,large and comfy room went for day stay to just have a short staycay the checkin was prompt room was large and comfy great location as its located in within orchard theres a shuttle bus service from the hotel to the forum mall recommended to stay with mercure
1376,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,warm service super fast service checking and out during the stay staffs were so welcoming and explained things in detailed on checking out room was spacious than i expected and staffs walking around the hotel was very heartwarming giving a smile will visit again soon
1377,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,nice hotel but bring your own conditioner this hotel shares premises with a novotel so pay attention to which side youre on the service was helpful and friendly the room was comfortable enough for one person for a twonight stay especially since i didnt spend much time there i was attending a conference at the nearby shangrila which would be walking distance if it wasnt so hot and humid outside instead it was a relatively quick taxi ride the hotel has plenty of food options inside and out there was a lovely outdoor lap pool for guests with time to lounge i also appreciated the currency exchange machine in the lobby the negatives are that the room was small and didnt have a real closet just a place to hang your clothes above the mini fridge the amenities only included a combined shampooconditioner that
1378,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,very poor to details and service i have arrange a night stay to celebrate my wife birthday upon reservation the reservation team said that a complimentary cake will be serve to celebrate my wife birthday however when we check in a presented our identification which clearly indicated my wifes birthday the concierge did not wish my wife a happy birthday when we went in the room there was no complimentary cake as promise in the email it seems that the team lacks service and attention to small details we made a dinner reservation to the food exchange as well which also promise a complimentary cake will be arrange for my wife but none was given on top of that food was not fresh and service was extremely poor the live station for noodles had no staff there and you have to wait a long time before
1379,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,another unexpected find value in singapore we have had two friends independently staty at accor very clean small rooms but very functional like a yotel or citizen m but much less expensive both friends raved about the mattress staff we interacted with very friendly and helpful lowered our rate we had the breakfast buffet very nice and good value for singapore since on the buslines very convenient about minute walking distance to heart of the orchard shopping district but pleasant walk we definitely recommend
1380,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great service small rooms stayed here for a night during a stop over service was good and the staff were professional and accommodating the room and the shower is small really small when compared to the one in roxy there is no wardrobe instead a small open air partition is available on top of the mini fridge the bed here was comfortable and air conditioning was good the hotel provides complimentary shuttle service
1381,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,overall is fine but definitely need improvement we booked nights stay at mercure on stevens where is located quite close to orchard hotel provides daily shuttle to dfs that is so convenient if you like shopping along orchard room we stayed at superior room on level room is small but sufficient as we dont stay in the room during the day insulation is not good as we can hear our neighbours tv is very user friendly i liked it very much shower is not good temperature is not stable and it takes long time when you adjust the hot cold shampoo and shower gel toothpaste kit are provided ladies please bring your own cotton pad and cotton sticks that what i do always for staying whichever star hotels service our dustbin was not cleared on the first day i had to write a note and left on the table next day on
1382,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,mercure very nice location close to orchard rd the service is excellent the infinity pool is breathtaking it is a new hotel about minutes from changi airport and minutes from the marina bay we loved our stay there
1383,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good for business trip staying for a week for business trip found the hotel location nearby to the city centre nearby bus station and good selection of breakfast minus the speaker in room cannot connected with my phone
1384,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,overall good hotel great location good amenities and helpful staff would defiantly stay there again all in all good value for money toilet is a bit on the small side and if you are coming in late after pm there was no people managing the bags as we arrived in normal instances would not be a bother but on this transit trip me and my wife were carrying alot of bags this was sorted once we entered and informed the front desk overall a great experience which could have been perfect with the bags being attended to upon disembarking from the cab check out and stay was close to perfect thank you
1385,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,wouldve been a nice stay without the hordes of chinese tourists this hotel is brand new i stayed there last march just after it opened and decided that for an exhibition in may three of us would be attending itd be perfect little did i know some bright egghead in their sales dept thought it would be a good idea to market their hotel to mainland china tour groups but didnt think to upgrade their hardware when the tour buses arrive the small lobby is overrun with charmingly not loud countryside bumpkins if you arrive at the same time i didnt your checkin could take an hour going to your room could take another mn the elevators and the elevator lobby are not sized for tour groups the buses that ferry them stay parked with their engines on them tourists need aircon as soon as they board you see i reported a bus that
1386,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,overall still ok just stay for nitethe room is very small but the bed is comfortablethe hotel is quite far to shopping area luckily they got shuttle bus or take a bus to shopping areathe breakfast to me is average overall is ok for short stay
1387,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,very modern and comfortable we had an awesome stay fast check in process very handy shuttle bus free to orchard road it took only minutes awesome infinity pool very comfortable bed during our stay it rained and the hotel provided umbrella to use and return i recommend this hotel will definitely stay here again qatar air crew stay here as well
1388,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,slightly isolated from orchard road we stayed nights on a business trip this is a property with accor hotels occupying a same building and sharing the pool and gym mercure is on the left hand side and novotel is on the right hand side the hotel is located slightly off orchard road not quite walkable in singapore weather hence the hotel does provide a shuttle service to orchard road since singapore is very small we used grab or taxi it is reasonably price the hotel room is small compared to south east asians standard also in such a hot weather the hotel dont provide sufficient complementery waters in the room the hotel breakfast is of average somehow accor asia cant provide good meal service is the same in order mercure in singapore also some that i stayed in kuala lumpur in the contrary
1389,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great value for money from the first minute you step out off a cab you feel like you are in much more expensive hotel that you paid for classy stylish modern and great staff great food and service and good variety at breakfast both pools are great especially the infinity with a view free daily almost nonstop shuttle to orchard and back was a lovely little bonus we had a great two weeks
1390,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,sweet touch for birthday in advance previously stayed at mercure roxy and the thoughtfulness for celebrations are really good so decide to try stevens under the same brand totally did not expect the little decor and cake for my birthday in advance this gives me the impression that mercure hotels are just thoughtful for celebrations hehe the staff are all super friendly and checkin was hasslefree overall i had a positive stay although the room and bathroom are considered small for my liking some people have written that the mrt to the hotel is far but i dont feel it that way at most just minutes lol i suggest to at least book the second smallest room as the smallest is already too small i think thank you mercure stevens
1391,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,missing tv remote control overall still a good place to stay i booked this hotel again because i enjoyed my stay during the previous trip however this time i had some difficulties during the check in process we managed to resolve the issue and i finally went to my room the first thing i always do is to switch on the tv but the remote control was nowhere to be found i immediately inform the staff on the missing item but i guess they were short handed and took a long time to send a new remote control to my room even after a few calls i was getting really impatient because i never imagined this could happen to a hotel chain like mercure and moreover i really needed to go out soon those were the hiccups that i experienced otherwise it was a great experience staying in this hotel again
1392,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,god ratio price quality for many years i used to go in the novotel downtown and i decided to try this mercure in a complex with a novotel the location is quite far from the center the room is quite small but new and nice it was comfortable bed also but the bathroom is really too small as a platinum member i was upgraded at the highest floor but i think that surface is the same than for other rooms nespresso coffee in the room and mini bar wifi is correctly working bed sheets are not changed every day but i you ask they do staff is pleasant and relations with business manager good i had pcs per day of free laundry i didnt have time to try the swimming pools the lounge is in the novotel it is really quiet you can eat and work easily food is good and changed everyday
1393,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,simple and clean booked in for one night in this property not too large only sqm and minimalistic no carpet a small area for you to hang your clothes the bathroom is interesting seems to be wellequipped for older folks as there are grab bars and a seat for the shower with no curb to delinate the shower it looks spacious but you have to be careful not to wet the whole floor a floor mat should be provided so that some area can still remain dry and the small sink area could do with another shelf for you to put your personal amenities i can see that housekeeping needs to be more proactive in reporting defects the toilet roll holder in my room was missing a cap at the end and in one of the toilets near the ballroom was missing a cover for the door handle but overall the
1394,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,wonderful night stay great value for money for nights which included full buffet breakfast every morning evening drinks in the privilege lounge with a great selection of canapés and free mini bar everyday the service at the mercure is something very special to spend nights at a hotel and not have any complaints is spectacular my only negative is the room size if you are like me and dont pack lightsorry not sorry the room is to small if you are only staying one or two nights it would be fine but staying nights was a challenge the hotel did offer us a bigger room at an addition however we could not justify it ladies you will not like the size of the bathroom very limited bench space the double size shower is nice overall our only negative was the room
1395,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,perfect stopover location set next to the slightly posher novotel the mercure doesnt disappoint nice pool and good restaurant and the staff are just lovely great location for me near to my office rooms are a little small but perfectly adequate very good value also
1396,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,jerome room a bit too small work desk too small early morning taxi and breakfast were not available even though confirmed by staff the night before soubndproofness between rooms could be improved nice choice of hot dishes at breakfast but choices of bread very limited which is very unusual for a mercure staff friendly and helpful
1397,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,ideal short stay hotel very friendly staff who were very attentive facilities especially the pool were most appreciated rooms are clean comfortable but a little small if staying for a longer period we had a one night stay and a late second day checkout with bag collection late afternoon all of which was all handle efficiently lift access using room cards was at times problematic but nothing overwhelming
1398,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,just right for a quick business trip with all the essentials and superb service when you dont need a large room and want all the basic essentials provided with quality and that unmistakable essence of great service from well trained and attentive staff this is it the staff attention is what youd expect for a luxury resort and yet it is contained in this gem of a hotel grab drivers appeared in notime and sometimes were even waiting the club level is perfect with the right amount of treats for a satisfying meal at breakfast or dinner
1399,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,beautiful and refreshing had a pleasant and wonderful day quick check in friendly staff beautiful room quiet environment good location the list goes onwould i stay again of cos small café serving light snacks next to the reception is a brilliant idea
1400,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,short stay ideal hotel to stay cleancomfortable affordable and modern rooms shuttle bus operating to main shopping area and all the local restaurants used this time for short hour stay between cruise and flight but would definitely stay here next visit helpful and friendly staff
1401,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,small room althoughit was handy for metro and local bus there was nothing much in the area hotel ran shuttle service t orchard road room was very small suitable for one person rather than two lobby bar lacked atmosphere and closed at pm sharp concierge was very helpful and offered good advice about getting singapore made good use of tourist a pass
1402,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,modern hotel with tiny rooms the hotel together with the sister novotel building create the convenient and modern accomodation complex in the decent part of the town there is only walking distance to the orchard road and the hotel offers also the shuttle bus to the city centre the mutual space like gym and swimming pools are spacious and impressive in contrast to the standard rooms tiny and rather basic the big advantage of this place is also pretty good choice of dinning options oferring various cuisines and price level however the breakfast served in the winestone was rather dull with limited choice of food the staff especially front desk team is very helpful and attentive good hotel for a short stay or transit in the acceptable fee
1403,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,impressed this was my first visit here was impressed with the service food and ambience of the hotel good job my only grouse was that the breakfast they had eggs which could be fried for us but this was not made known to us we only found out after we had our bfast and were leaving
1404,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice stopover checked in late at night and happy to see an upgraded room all laid out staff were very friendly and efficient at the same time breakfast was excellent good recommendation by one of the passing chefs on the masala tea i am a coffee drinker he guaranteed me i would like the tea and i really did nice cold beers at the bar too all in all the staff were super friendly its my nd trip back and yes i will be back
1405,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,good facilities tiny room this hotel is part of a complex including a sister property a novotel and a number of restaurants it offers the reasonable standard of comfort but not luxury that a mercure usually does a particularly appreciated feature is the sports facilities shared by the two hotels the gym is adequate in terms of size and availability of machines while the pool isunusually for many hotel poolsrectangular and long enough to swim laps a drawback is the very small room size which leaves inadequate space for suitcases and a tiny bathroom with virtually no useable surface areas there is also an issue in that anything involving interaction with the front desk will take an interminable amount of time and involve long queues this was a constant frustration over several days the
1406,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good located and nice place to stay found this hotel on stevens no to far from our office in singapore it is in my eyes fantastic located not far from orchard and not so crowded the hotel is modern with friendly staff stayed on the floor and realized a very short waiting time for the elevator the breakfast in winestone restaurant could have some more vegan options all in all very good with friendly staff as well but you should come early as later on it is busy good located hotel with minutes to the airport and close in walking distance to orchard will choose this hotel again pricewise ok and good for business trips
1407,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,ok for a short trip we stayed here for a couple of night on a stopover the rooms are very small and dont even think about touching the mini bar unless you take a mortgage out it is what it is quick stop hotel a plus side they do run a free shuttle bus to the shopping quarters which was handy as emirates forgot to load our cases on at dubai thanks
1408,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great service at very reasonable price great staff location drinks room service quick check in and out great service overall but the waiting time for taxi is a bit long due to not many taxis are coming into the hotel premises hopefully the hotel staff can be more attentive to this
1409,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,perfect for staycation the level of service was simple great from the moment i checkedin the room was superbly clean and comfortable the breakfast was also perfect and not overbearing a perfect hotel for a short stay or staycation
1410,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,new stay hotel in singapore seeing hotel location quiet where my office is at orchard road can walk there with bit more than min good comfortable bed was arranged was appreciated newly facility with kind staff was available at this hotel

1412,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,top tier service my wife and i were amazed at the level of service we received here all of the hotel staff were really nice and helpful the lobby was quiet and the internet was fast the best thing about the hotel for us was the restaurant catherine is an amazing server and she made our experience completely unforgettable this restaurant is truly blessed to have such dedicated employees who go above and beyond to provide their customers with five star service thank you mercure winestone and thank you catherine

1417,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,lovely businesslike hotel with great pools and a wellequipped gym this hotel is m from the nearest mrt station stevens and there is a bus stop right outside which will take you either to the metro or into the cbd orchard road and beyond while the rooms are quite small i understand this is normal for singapore and youre not going to be in the room for long the pools are both lovely
1418,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice hotel with nice surrounding well designed hotel nice rooms very good gym and perfect pool area cleanliness of rooms could be better a lot of nice places in good walking distance managmenet should make concessions regrading late checkout amoung other thinks this is a question of service philosophy
1419,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,fantastic stop over fantastic value for moneywe only booked basic room as we were arriving late so this level room was small but hotel facilities for the price was fantasticbeautiful pool and a variety of bar and eatery areas to choose fromthe room was well attired and the bed and pillows were very comfortableclean and modernheading off exploring today we can see it is very well positioned for orchard road area linked to novotel so you can enjoy the choice of facilities at both hotels

1421,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,great place to stay with a big room although this hotel isnt the best location because of distance to the mrt dont let that stop you from staying here the room i stayed in was large by singapore standards even had two toilets the service was very good i even got a welcome rose upon my arrival on valentines day
1422,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,work pleasure we enjoyed an extended stay at this new clean hotel located close to mrt and within walking distance to orchard hotel has shuttle bus as well we enjoyed the daily breakfast and happy hour in the executive lounge entire staff was professional and extremely friendly and helpful our stay extended to weeks we look forward to returning here our next visit to singapore
1423,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,average hotel in the city we spent our last night in singapore in mercure hotel i love the interior of theroomaverage size but clean and neat gym is nice and the swimming pool is superb i always love infinity pool great location just few bus stop to orchard roadbut they have free shuttle to orchard overall we enjoyed our stay here
1424,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,a good place to chill out check in was a brisk and there wasnt any crowd though the room is slightly small it is very clean and modern the room is quite cold and you can turn off the air con at night the wifi connection is strong but the room wifi account allows you to connect to only devices the infinity pool is great the gym is big and modern i used the thread mill and i was impressed with the virtual run with beautiful ai sceneries shown on the tv panel as i run the hotel is near to orchard road get a copy of the free shuttle bus schedule from the check in staff take a picture of it so that you can plan your shopping and tour accordingly to the bus schedule the bus brings you right to the hotel door step and it is a mini air conditioned bus the bus runs for every thirty minutes
1425,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,slow service in a modernly furnished bar our friends stayed at this hotel and we took a few drinks at the modernly furnished bar the bartender was absolutely not professional and very slow we couldnt have access to the wifi since we were not staying in this hotel only spending money at their bar after two bad experiences we went to another bar where we got an excellent service and free wifi
1426,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nat great staystaff very friendly loved the infinity pool room a little small but we only slept in the room so ok we upgraded to the king bed that gave us free mini bar and from we had snacks and drinks in the lounge complimentary we only stayed days great location
1427,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,singaporerrelaxing great hotel new and clean great pools very good breakfast buffet and excellent and responsive and very professional staff the staff were exceptional they were always ready to help resolve any problems if needed i had several that had nothing to do with the hotel and made my stay memorable
1428,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,star close to shopsorchard rd free daily min shuttle professional staff very clean and peaceful rooms great internal and external restarauntsbars best buffet breakfast i will be back loved it
1429,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,value for money the location is good with free shuttle bus to a metro nearby very friendly staff very good breakfast good cleaning the room is not big but big enough a lot of different restaurants in the same location nice training facilities and outdoor swimming pool the hotel is only one years old with very good standard a very nice experience and absolutely value for money
1430,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great location whilst we only stayed one night i really cant fault this hotel check in was friendly and efficient we spent the afternoon in the lobby waiting for our flight and felt more than welcome to do so the room was clean and spacious the bed very comfortable the area surrounding the hotel was very nice with just a ten minute walk to the metro on leaving the staff couldnt have been more helpful calling a taxi and insisting on taking our luggage to the car oh and the coffee was first class
1431,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,reasonably priced hotel that covers all the basics we stayed for nights at the hotel during a short trip to singapore the hotel is located in a small complex in a posh residential area so its relatively quiet the complex has some dining options we did not take the hotel breakfast because right outside the hotel lobby is a pappa rich restaurant which serves malaysian cuisine including local breakfast it is located right next to the novotel which we have stayed in previously the room was rather small compared to the novotel next door but functional with a minimalist aesthetic a minor complaint about the bathroom design which has tall toilet seats it may not be comfortable for those with smaller statures a free shuttle bus to scotts road makes exploring and shopping easy service was good no complaints a good
1432,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,modern and contemporary stayed one night in mercure stevens room was on the smaller side but equipped with everything you would need no work desk in the room it had a very nice lounge chair instead not an issue as i managed to have great coffee at the cafe at lobby while getting work done there very friendly staff great stay at good value
1433,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,stay in mercure singapore on stevens great experience new modern courteous and professional staff excellent facilities only thing to improve is breakfast buffet need more local food and more variety and quantity so the food trays do not run out so fast
1434,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,business trip had a pleasant night stay at the hotel staff are very helpful courteous breakfast was nice situated close proximity to orchard road you can really take a minute walk or the hotel provide half hourly shuttle service good business hotel
1435,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,affordable and average stayed at mercure stevens over the weekend with family and friends checkin was smooth and rooms were ready at pm the rooms were averagesize and very clean comfortable bed and pillows complimentary shuttle bus services from hotel lobbydfs galleria there are a few restaurants within the hotel premises as well we had issues with the keycards on different occasions frankly customer service experiences were below average eg there were a few frontdesk officers but non reached out welcoming guests i personally dont feel welcomed as accor member nor a public guest concierge team were excellent and helpful though overall we enjoyed our stay and support the hotel chain but i think there is still a room for improvement in the customer service area
1436,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,blocked credit card payments hi i stayed at your hotel from th jan till th jan today its th jan and still you have blocked payments on my credit card and have charged me the third payment for my entire stay please release the other two payment at the earliest
1437,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,disappointed we stayed here when it first opened and things have changed somewhat unfortunately not for the better was expecting a complimentary minibar as before but was told this was only available to certain categories of bookings and only after i happened to check there was not charge list in the room previously i booked the cheapest room rates and even got it refilled the carpark is now outsourced to a vendor and i was told limited to one complimentary coupon a day now for locals like me who drive and make multiple exits a day this doesnt work and is real silly especially for the location and the number of lots avail going back to novotel in feb and going to face the same carpark issue again hopefully rooms are really tiny even by local standards like everyone else has
1438,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,very good value though this hotel does have small rooms i was able to open and access my belongings from my two suitcases the highlight was that they have a hour laundromat coin laundry available in the building this is a nice alternative to expensive hotel laundry services my only complaint is that the cafe downstairs is extremely expensive if youre a coffee drinker you may find it hard to find another place close by to start your day with a coffee
1439,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,disappointed i was disappointed with this hotel i checked in online two days before i arrive and specifically stated in my form that there would be another guest with me however when i got to the room i was only provided with one of everything from towel to toothbrush to the room sandal although when i requested for the extra towel it came pretty quickly when i wanted to take a shower that night the water was cold and so i called the reception the technician came very quickly and what he did to fix the shower appalled me he said to turn on the tap at the basin and the shower at the same time for at least five minutes for the hotel to tell guest to preserve the environment by reusing the towels and to waste water because the hotel management cannot be bothered to fix the problem
1440,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,tiny rooms lovely hotel and staff nice restaurants and comfortable bed downside is the room size tiny now where to keep baggage bathroom has no shelf for toiletry bag so this is why its average for me pool area is nice all beit is the shade for a lot of the day and gym has all you need
1441,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,very happy sorry for late feedback thumbs up for the quality of service you offered for me and my mom for our stay at your hotel on eve new year every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive kind and professional including receptionists room service staff bell boy i will definitely recommend your hotel to our friends colleagues and family and im sure well be back
1442,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,very small rooms nice location friendly staff clean rooms and public areas free wifi lot of food outlets available in the hotel to choose from great dinner buffet and wide verity of food the hotel room are super small in size its hard to move around the bed or the toilet area
1443,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,brief but superb stay close enough to the orchard belt the room was a tad small but perfectly fine for our rest and one night stay after a long flight id like to commend the staff for being very attentive to requests and acceding to our request for a late checkout because we checked in rather late as well i was pleasantly surprised by their gesture thanks mercure on stevens we had a really great brief stay with you
1444,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good enough the only problem is the room is quite small may be good for person only room is clean and convenient location is ok good for bus but not near mrt station however they have the shuttle bus to t galleria every mins in general the hotel is quite good for its price
1445,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great stay excellent stay seamless check in and out and great room size and location very easy to get taxi and grab high recommended and will definitely come back with accorplus comes with great benefit staying at this hotel
1446,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,comfortable room had a brief nights stay in this hotel and found it to be comfortable and clean the staff were helpful and efficient the hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the centre of singapore which is very useful unfortunately i had difficulties relating to time differences and so did not get much chance to explore singapore i have no difficulty in recommending the hotel
1447,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,enjoyable stay comfortable bed the staff at the reception counter was really helpful and friendly she didnt keep me waiting for too long overall i love the room size and its details the bed is extremely comfortable and thats the best thing during my entire stay its just a pity that there are limited tv channels available i was starving when i checked in and i was really glad they have paparich restaurant right beside the hotel if you prefer to travel by mrt do take note that the mrt stations stevens and newton are not very near its about mins walk but there are designated walking paths with lots of trees along the road so it will be an enjoyable walk those whose like to have a jog in the morning or evening while staying here this is probably a nice hotel location for you
1448,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice location check in was always quick and swift room was clean and comfortable for me staff was friendly and cheerful location is nice as its near to orchard town swimming pool was nice to chill easy access to food during normal hours will visit soon again
1449,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,overpriced overrated stayed at mercure recently for nites and nite at novotel was very disappointed with the room size facilities of the mercure twin room totally agree with the reviewer on do not bring your cat as you will not have enough room to swing it with the facilities provided this hotel is not a mercure star according to accor standards but more suitable to be an ibis hotel stars we have been accor members for years and are frequent travelers and know what type of accor hotels standards to expect we were very glad our complaints were duly recognized by the asst front office manager pong perez who upgraded us to a deluxe room on the th floor when we checked in to the near door novotel hotel on our rd nite this upgrade also entitled us access to the
1450,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,amazing hotel we stay here from thth dec when the driver kindly told us that this hotel may not very center in the city it make us a little worried on the road but when we arrival we are shock at that moment that how is it beautiful and nice design actually after two days staying we found this hotel is very convenient by taxi the other transpotation is not far and convenient also it is near orchard road each morning you can try stand on the gate of hotel the green plants and out door café will bring you nice feeling during the staythe man who assistant us check in was very nice and the room facility was good use and perfectthe best was breakfast the gentleman and girl very nice service and food was delicious especially the whole wheat toast due to pay individual reason
1451,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,excellent hotel away from the city yet close the hotel is perfectly located in a residential area but still not very far from the city the rooms are quaint some may find it tiny but its good for single person people from mumbai wont complain the rooms are very comfortable with all the necessary amenities the buffet breakfast was excellent with choices of different cuisines including indian the stay was super comfortable and i had visited for a conference in singapore the only problem is if you arrive by early morning flight they wont allow you to checkin before pm which is definitely on the downside hope the management looks into this and allot the rooms if they are unoccupied
1452,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,comfortable and eco friendly the place has lots of green and even have a herbs garden the room is compact but the hotel compound is big filled with greens and with lots of restaurantsbars to choose from so overall it posed a tranquil atmosphere far from the noise of town area yet near enough to get to town the hotel also provide free shuttle service to town every half an hour the lap pool is awesome except for the last three days of my stay the housekeeping slackened badly and very tardy in keeping the room clean other than that overall is a good place to stay
1453,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hotel had a great stay at mercure singapore at stevens lots of fb options rooms are a bit small but it was sufficient and ok location is very convenient theyve regular shuttles to orchard road they staff are very helpful and service oriented
1454,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice hotel in residential area nice newer hotel in a residential area really about minute stroll to orchard roadmecure and novotel are blended into buildingnice pool staff was very nice and professionalsmallish rooms but we had a twin room and it was finejust dont bring a huge amount of suitcases and you will be okbreakfast buffet was good if a little on pricey sideafter the first day we just walked down to orchard for breakfast buffet was good on a very rainy morning
1455,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,service beyond expectation lovely executive lounge the executive lounge is a highlight of this hotel both service and food are excellent happy hour daily from pm wide range of food snacks and the best thing is they change the food offering everyday so guest that have longer stay wont get bored with the happy hour the service provided by the lounge manager mira sulaiman was beyond expectation and incredibly detail to attention she assisted us in reservation and room arrangement prior to our arrival to ensure we all enjoy a smooth and pleasant stay this level of service is the reason why i choose to stay here my every visit to singapore
1456,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,pleasant stay i enjoyed my stay at the hotel the room with a double bed was small but large enough for one person the staff were very nice several restaurants are on the grounds and that was nice since the area is residential orchard road is about minutes away on foot i walked though there is a shuttle i would stay there again
1457,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,leave the cat at home nice hotel and recently built however they have adopted the hk room size me my bag and i and not much room to swing the cat nice foyer and good staff facilities like pools and gym are shared with novotel locations is a bit far from shops and stations but they have a great shuttle bus system down to shops every mins small bathroom to but hot water takes minutes to get to normal temp plenty of restaurants in front of building but obviously not cheap cafe style food in foyer plus restaurant on level good wifi and some deck area on level two on the way to lap pool unfortunately the main pool is directly in front of the restaurant and i dont need everyone watching whilst they eat

1465,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,room for improvement brand new mercure hotel in singapore this is the usual standard for mercure and the rooms are ok although the staff is friendly you can notice that they arent well trained they arent proactive and only say no without offering an alternative also the bar closes early

1468,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,the perfect hotel for a quick stay planned a solo rrip with friends coming over from miami opted for mercure because of the location as well as the excellent value for money a good min drive from the airport check in was quick and efficient with concierge ensuring luggage to my room novotel was right beside mercure and shated restaurants as well as gym snd pools room was adequate for single person bathroom was tad bit small but no complains room was compact but it was tidy and all spaces were creatively utilized bed was comfortable and room had all the required amenities including minibar safe open closet the gym and the lap pool were the stars of the show i used the gym everyday spacious and with all the required equipments for a complete workout just tht the equipments should be cleaned

1470,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,new hotel comfortable stay we arrived at the hotel on saturday afternoon and stayed there for nights the hotel is new and therefore our expectation for cleanliness was met the room smells fresh the housekeeping personnel did a good job in cleaning the room the size however is kind of small but should be fine if you are traveling as a couple or solo for business the hotel is just a short walk to orchard if you are a fitness junkie it can take you minutes to get to orchard road there is also a bus stop just outside the hotel if you happen to be late for the free shuttle service of the hotel shuttle bus will drop you off dfs building which is in front of far east plaza you can take bus or its only bus stop away to the orchard road hotel facilities are nice and new there are
1471,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,comfortable clean and great location would personally recommend this hotel to business travelers and couples a self catered hotel its great for a short stay lots of restaurants including papa roti are within the complex there are regular shuttles to orchard road from the hotel very neat clean hotel and lovely location my only drawback being that they did not have any sanitary napkins when i urgently needed them and had to go down to orchard road missing a part of my event would suggest that even if made available for purchase they should be a basic amenity made available to the guests
1472,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,great value for what its worth despite already experiencing novotel singapore on stevens in apri i decided to redeem it at the same premise bearing both properties as it is still one of the newer accor properties which ive never stayed at which offers a club lounge well actually also because it is one of the ones more available for redemption at last minute notice week im not complaining price complimentary due to my accor plus stay plus benefit but a quick check on their official site showed sgd for a superior room and for a privilege room prior to arrival i had informed the reservations team of an anniversary occasion and mustered up enuf skin to directly request for an upgrade to the privilege room a double upgrade from my booked superior room check in so i made sure i
1473,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice hotel in singapore fairly new hotel situated on stevens road about minutes from orchard road which has every facility a fussy traveler could ask for a lot of restaurantsbars and pools food is great and getting to and from the city is no problemthe hotel has a shuttle bus to and from the city but it is sometimes full so a taxi or bus is the alternative rooms are clean and well servicedstaff are great and very helpfulgreat stay

1476,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,enjoyable stay and centrally located friendly staff i recommend the mercure on stevens for a few reasons it delivers the mercurenovotelaccor brand so you get what you expect the hotel is ideally located near orchard road shopping rooms are quite small but clean and nice the hot water was absent that day only negative remark restaurant was quite good excellent buffet staff were exceptionally good an helpful price was very good for singapore everything was mostly smooth and easy
1477,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,the best service amir from the concierge department always open the door for me when i arrive at the hotel he even remembers my name this is the kind of service even some of the five star hotels cannot deliver definitely worth every penny i spent
1478,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hotel with friendly staff great location near the botanic gardens and walking distance to the centre areas plenty of transportation options as well the staff were so helpful and friendly there are several places to grab a bite or sit down and have a meal right onsite or in the buildings nearby the gym is lovely and clean and there is an amazing pool as well highly recommend i will stay here again if i am ever back in singapore
1479,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,friendly staff and easy check in i really love the very accommodating staff of mercure they will not let you get bored of waiting on the line they will make sure you are comfortable and at home i love staying in mercure since it is near to everything restaurants are just nearby they have a shuttle going to the shopping malls in orchard i will definitely go back here again
1480,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,very small rooms very friendly and efficient staff in all areas of the hotel but we were shocked at how small the rooms are i asked for an upgrade to a larger room and was willing to pay but was told all the rooms were the same size executive suite which would cost an extra a night breakfast was lovely but each and we only had it on one morning however as the mercure is co located with the novotel we had breakfast there for the remaining days we were there as it was much quieter the food in the restaurant for dinner is limited but there are a couple of different eating places which was good and you can walk to orchard road or there is a shuttle bus which is very convenient overall a very enjoyable stay but the hotel is definitely more of an ibis hotel rather than a mercure we
1481,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,fantastic hotel we sadly only stayed here for one night as a stopover to london we arrived way before check in and a room was available the service at the front desk to being greeted by the manager on duty to the room was a great size with separate living to bedroom the choice of restaurants around the hotel was unbelievable highly recommend this hotel
1482,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good value brand new hotel i stayed here for one night during a quick work trip very clean nicely finished rooms in a new hotel perfect if you just want a place to sleep and it is also very reasonably priced for singapore very close to orchard road although many people will probably opt for a taxi or grab rather than walking make sure to get a bigger room if you want to work as there was no desk in the smaller room i booked they also provide all the complementary toiletries you need if you are taking a quick trip and just want to travel with hand luggage which is a nice touch food was decent good value and i would definitely stay here again
1483,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,friendly staff and easy check in i really love staying on this hotel love the room food the warm welcome of the staffs free welcome drinks you will not get bored even while waiting for the check in i will definitely go back here
1484,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,adequate but not exceptional to be honest there were no real complaints about my visit but nothing stood out either the room was quite small but ok for my purposes the staff were extremely helpful but their reception desk was always busy and a little on the slow side large breakfast options but not quite as good as other asian hotels i have stayed at it was nice to see eggs benedict as an offering for the buffets but they think this is eggs with hollandaise sauce on a muffin no ham though i would have though any executive chef would know this classic is made room service options are very limited and mostly western food though their are half a dozen restaurants within the complex you are in a residential area so their are no other shops in the vicinity so you are isolated they do offer a shuttle
1485,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,amazing stay i had stayed in mercure few times already and one thing i really appreciate is the staff especially hazel in the coffee shop in the lobby and a korean staff who helps us to get taxi outside of the lobby im sorry i didnt get his name i feel that they genuinely cares for the customers and welcome each and everyone with a beautiful smile which makes me so happy to come back again everyone in mercure team seems to really enjoy their job and happy thank you for making my each visit special with the genuine care thank you
1486,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great stay at mercure on stevens i had a long stay at the hotel days rooms are good cozy bed is awesome especially for me as i have disc hernia bed and pillows matter quite a bit service was great called them a few times prompt and helpful with information there are two pools one which is long and helps if you like swimming long distance and another one for chilling mode gym was great comes in fully equipped and always very clean regardless of when i used it the cleaning staff kept on coming by and made sure everything was in order thank you jeff for being so friendly felt like home location is great there are metrotrain stations in walking distance and if you hate walking then there are plenty of bus choices going to major metrotrain lines and the hotel has its own shuttle to the

1489,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great location the room is clean and new location is very near orchard minutes away from far east plaza price is well worth the money and i would come back again to this hotel given the price and great location of this place well recommended
1490,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,family birthday celebration dined at food exchange with family on october like to say big thanks to chef ismail and manager william ismail was mending the noodles section and was cooking with smiles and joy on his face at the same time very helpful though it wasnt his area of responsibilities william the manager was in control and leading the team well during the busy dinner period great job and thank you for your service guys
1491,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hotel in singapore nice new hotel situated about minutes by bus or hotel shuttle bus in to orchard road and shoppingthis hotel has a variety of restaurants that will amaze you the rooms are a bit on the small side and no room for storage but when travelling around living out of a suitcase is not too badgreat swimming pools and the service is great breakfast would fulfill any ones desire and the food in the restaurants is first class staff are very friendly and helpful
1492,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,new modern hotel with really small rooms this is a new hotel with a modern look but the rooms are really small staying here reminded me of my hotel in tokyo staff is not the best but also not the worst not too far away from orchard wont stay here again because the entire room was the size of most hotels bathrooms
1493,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,modern but small clean and modern set up for the mercure next the novotel the staff is trying hard and most of them are smiling and caring the rooms are very small though if you put your bag on the floor you cannot walk around the bed no tabledesk neither so for a business traveler needing to work it is not ideal go to the lounge not open yet so youve got to transfer to the novotels which is ok breakfast at the restaurant downstairs is a mess sorry but when they put the buffet food in corners where people are trying to walk it becomes clogged quickly we much preferred the coffee shop where first the coffee is good the service fast you can just grab a fruit or a muffin and it is times cheaper must improve
1494,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,can a hotel room get any smaller im a big fan of the accor hotels however i must say that i was less than pleased when i checked into the relatively new mercure hotel on stevens road in singapore this would have to be the tiniest hotel room i have ever stayed in the issue was compounded by the fact that my wife and i were travelling together it is hard enough for one person to be comfortable in the room doubly hard for people
1495,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,an oasis a stones throw away from orchard it was my first time staying in this new upbeat hotel just bus stops away from orchard city center my firt impression is that the hotel complex mercure novotel is much larger and more classy than even other facilities with the same brands given the presence of yes thats eleven great restaurant options in mercure stevens just below the hotel the staff were friendly and the pools are also very nice and well maintained there is also a hr gym i love it so much i stayed here again weeks later this time in novotel stars
1496,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good business hotel great location during my recent business trip to singapore i opted to stay at this star property located on stevens road in orchard area this sprawling property have rooms to suit travellers requirement the hotel allows normal check in at hours and normal check out at hours check in was smooth i booked a superior double room for single occupancy through a popular online hotel booking site for nights without breakfast i paid sg not bad considering the luxury let us now move to the review of facilities and my experience rating have been assigned in a scale of to being highest a location very conveniently located on stevens road in orchard area within km from the vivrant orchard road and scotts road two of the best shopping streets in
1497,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,visit singapore i stayed with my family for one night and everything was ok friendly staff good breakfast with many options the room is small but very clean the price is ok for what it offers compared to other hotels
1498,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,housekeeping standards needs serious review the hotel was new and the facilities were nice what surprised me was the low standards of hygiene and housekeeping when i first entered the bathroom i noticed the toilet seat had yellowish urine stains all over it i tried to clean it off but found that the stains were permanent then i noticed that one of the glasses in the bathroom was stained with toothpaste it was obviously used by the previous occupant but was left unwashed i put the dirty glass aside in hope that the housekeeper would change it the next morning to my horror it was not replaced by a clean one but the very same dirty glass was put back on top of the coaster for use it was a disgusting discovery i had used one of the teacups in the room chipped at the base by someone else and placed it in the
1499,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good choice we all know accommodation in sg can be very expensive and yet this hotel offers really reasonable prices i agree with some reviews mentioning the location and room size that make the good price but its singapore where a beer can cost you up to it may need extra walks to go to orchard road but its really safe to walk in sg and hotel do offer shuttle bus what i really like about the hotel that everything they do is very up in accor standard where as mercure in other countries ive been staying could not bethe hotel and novotel is actually in building there are swimming pools which are lap pool and infinity pool as silver member i was offered welcome drink voucher which i can use in either mercure or novotel cant say im in love with this hotel but i have no
1500,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,a great find mercure on stevens has been a happy surprise i was traveling on business and this was the perfect place to start and go back to everyday service has been outstanding from the first minute staff were friendly and helpful room was not that big but due to smart layout did not feel cramped at all it was perfect for my need with all needed amenities the hotel is situated in a nice neighborhood i will go for walk every night after i was back from work if you are planning to travel by mrt this one might be a difficult choice since its roughly more than a km of walk other than that the location is perfect they offer free shuttle to orchard road whole day and to botanical garden twice in the morning i didnt get to use the swimming pool gym or the restaurants but they
1501,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,excellent stay in singapore near orchad district i went on a business trip for weeks and stayed most of the period in the mercure hotel on stevens road in fact at the location there are two hotels a mercure and a novotel they have two big pools one for lap swimming and one infinity pool towels are always provided and at the lap pool there is a big gym with very good equipment a tennis court is also available which i didnt usealso they have restaurants to choose from since i am a platinum member they upgraded me to free lounge access and free breakfast in the mornings at the lounge there was always free drinks and really good food in the evening i really had a wonderful time staying in this hotel and i will rebook it anytime i must go back to singapore i forgot to mention that the location is very
1502,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice business hotel in a quiet location this hotel is reasonably priced for an accor property in singapore but that is probably down to its location and small rooms as long as you are taking taxis or can schedule your travel according to their shuttle services you wont be badly off the hotel complex shared with its sister property the novotel on stevens features a number of eateries at typical midlevel price points rooms are on the small side especially the bathroom but comfortable and clean just dont plan to work from your hotel because bizarrely for a business hotel there is no desk in the room
1503,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,enjoyed being here good functional room as you would expect from a mercure basic but clean linked and shared facilities with novotel next door great restaurants around the pool was the highlight its the cleanest pool ive seen in yrs ie i could see one end to the other underwater it was about metres which was great to swim laps surrounded by greenery and towers it felt like a private city escape the gym was also large and well equipped the only flaw was it was easy to get into town from this hotel but not so easy to get back
1504,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,my favourite buffet dinner i did not actually stay here but came over for buffet dinner with my family i would say the buffet range which happens to be oyster buffet dining that night was excellent the range was good and good price too would definitely come back again as mostly the food are my favourite
1505,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice hotel on the quiet area of singapore yet close to the city we had nice experience staying there location is good because its close to bus stops which links us to anywhere we want to go to the sites directly or to another transportation hub like mrt stations also the staffs are pretty nice and have the willingness to help us when we do ask for certain things during our stay the only issue we had were variations in breakfast size of the room and a bit cramped when we sit on toilet bowlother than that we are quite satisfied with the services and facilities provided
1506,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,new hotel but rooms are too small the location is fine its surrounded by many midrange price restaurants and cafes not too near to the mrt station but getting a taxi is not a problem there everything is good because the hotel is pretty new but the rooms are unexpectedly small i think this is the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed throughout my countless trips in singapore people with bigger size might encounter problem in moving around the washroom to be honest i could get a bigger room in other hotels around downtown area at the same price but overall its still a great one despite needing to stay in such a small hotel room
1507,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,amazing this is my first time in singapore to celebrate my early birthday mercure steven is my choice ter reception is so nice with smiles quickly check in and giving me a cake to my birthday room was maked up everyday and pool is wonderful thanks for everything
1508,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,more that what i have expected i book the room as it was the cheaper option and it was only for night so i didnt want to spend more but the room was better than i thought the gso accommodated to my request to get a higher floor i knew the room was small even before i booked but it sort of felt spacious upon entering the room loved the bed as it was nice and soft and had a really good sleep with the curtains literally covering up all the sunlight the hotel had many food selection downstairs instead of having to order room service if you were lazy to head out overall very impressed with the place and would definitely go back there to stay again if i had another chance
1509,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,night stay my husband and i recently had a night stay here on our way to copenhagen and a baltic cruise the hotel was booked by our travel agent but i must say we were very disappointed the room was so tiny and we found it very cramped my husband is foot inches tall and quite a big man so movement in the room was difficult we were also disappointed in its location quite a long way from the city i had hoped to do some some shopping but unfortunately didnt get the opportunity
1510,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,comfortable stay stayed here for nights during a short trip for work i stayed in the standard room i was in a rush when making my booking so i have to admit i accidentally booked this hotel thinking it was a hotel i previously saw beside newton mrt i was wrong this hotel is a few minutes drive away from orchard with no mrt within a quick walking distance though it is near stevens mrt station in the blue line about bus stops away they however provide a free shuttle every minutes that drops you off at dfs at orchard there is also a bus stop in front of the hotel with direct buses to orchard about stops or just take grabtaxi about to orchard ion my standard room was quite compact no work desk so i had to make use of the bed as a make shift table other than that it
1511,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,staycation at mercure singapore on stevens i have been here twice bed is comfortable the most comfortable so far compared to all my other staycations in singapore after comparing more than hotels room is very clean and nice shower is good too a great place to stay to relax and recharge after a busy week the male manager at the reception during checkin is not particularly friendly during both occasions and does not smile and greet guests even when spoken to as a senior staff working in the hospitality industry i find this rather inappropriate and unwelcoming and gives a negative impression to the image of the hotel the junior staff at the reception showed more courtesy and was more welcoming and helpful when asked questions on room and availability hospitality to guests needs improvement
1512,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,trendy italian restaurant went there for lunch with my wife and another couple to celebrate our birthdays with my accorplus dining vouchers we ordered an assortment of food and drinks to share food was quite tasty and portions were just right for us as were not big eaters good service overall have recommended this place to some of my relatives
1513,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,i think the hotel staff unzipped my toiletries bag and touched my skincare products well i checked in to the hotel for a weeks stay and put my toiletries bag on the end table thinking that it should be safe to be kept there when i opened the lid of my moisturizer at night i noticed that the inner lid was upside down and the product was all over the cover i will never turn my lid upside down as i have a little ocd and will never put the outer part inwards it irks me to think that my moisturizer has been touched and may now be contaminated plus they didnt replenish my coffee powder the hotel management should train their house cleaning staff and ensure they do not touch guests personal belongings
1514,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good stay in welllocated hotel mercure singapore on stevens is a cozy hotel conveniently located along stevens road to get there from stevens mrt station take bus at bus stop aft stevens station and alight after two stops at bus stop novotel mercure stevens mercure and novotel on stevens are right beside each other at this location so dont get confused both these hotels are strategically positioned if you intend to raid orchard road for your shopping and culinary fix for the duration of your stay if you take bus at bus stop orchard road is three stops away alight at bus stop at orchard stationtang plaza this places you a few minutes walk away from ion orchard takashimaya wisma atria tang plaza and lucky plaza hotel staff are friendly and
1515,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,poor standard from accor i am staying here with my children and friends in rooms for nights so far the standard has been poor my husband is a platinum member and we travel accor many times throughout the year when we arrived at the front desk we were told one of our rooms wasnt ready at pm check in is at we were advised that they would send the key up shortly at there was still no room and i went down and asked again still not ready it took until pm to finally get the room we paid for the lady at the front desk was rude disinterested and unapologetic we are now sitting at breakfast at and half the food is empty there was almost no fruit trays of empty cold food terrible and not up to accor standard i will not stay here again and advise you to do the same
1516,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,pleasant stay stayed here for nights and really enjoyed it except small room i guess all new hotels in singapore come with small room as a platinum accor member you get free upgrade complimentary mini bar welcome pack access to lounge since mercure lounge is not opened yet therefore we can use novotel lounge happy hour from pm where you can enjoy some snacks like sushi free flow of drinks breakfast also provided a lot of varieties available from continental indian etc there are pools and gym available which i did not try but looks good shuttle bus also provided to orchard stop at dfs t galleria every half an hour with rest time from pm dining outlets also available in this hotel compound definitely would come back again
1517,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great location staff and hotel we stayed in this hotel with my wife and years old daughter for a week and it exceeded our expectations the staff were great from the checkin until check out and more always ready to help during the whole stay the rooms are a bit small but comfortable and has all the amenities teacoffee making facilities iron nice smart tv so you can watch your movies or just youtube on a big screen minibar was complementary and served well for some beers or snacks apart from that very clean breakfast was good with variety of options the pools on the second floor with the kids room worked great and we spent lots of time there the location is very close to orchard road just bus stops where you have heaps of restaurants hawkers shopping malls and the hotel offers free

1519,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,memorable birthday surprise we stayed for night to celebrate mine and my partners birthday since were both august babies the facade of the hotel is very grand with their huge driveway and water fountain accommodating both mercure novotel which is just side by side we were greeted by smiling conciergebellman the lobby reception is small and its directly connected to fudebar offering bread and pastries the front office associate who checked us in was helpful and patient the room layout is the same with what is advertised on their website but expect it to be small since its only sqm if im not wrong its good enough for single or travelers but not more we were genuinely surprised with their birthday decoration the effort of the staff is heartfelt and they are very creative with the
1520,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,nice facilities tiny room i stayed at mercure singapore on stevens when i had to travel home to europe on short notice and the best option was to go via singapore with an overnight stay my flight on the next day was around midnight so i booked the room for two nights to not have to fight for a late checkout i knew the city was very busy as my regular singapore hotel was fully booked the second night i have to say i wasnt too impressed upon arrival and the departure was also not awesome but most of what i experienced in between was pretty good my checkin took quite some time and the reception area was very noisy as a reward i got a room with a doublebed on the th floor and some brief information about the hotel but that part could have been better handled when is breakfast served
1521,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,mercure by name ibis by nature new hotel with all the facilities youd expect from a mercure good pool great staff breakfast good enough for a buffet close to mrt buses outside room has all new fixtures and fittings obviously but it is tiny no room to move or properly unpack which is why i liken it to an ibis nothing wrong with ibis but mercure is supposed to be a step up good design can eliminate issues of smaller spaces however accor dont seem to realise this and have missed an opportunity by using the same old stock standard hotel design seen throughout the world having said that its adequate but personally i wouldnt stay again
1522,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,best holiday and hotel experience ever i have just spent my night holiday in singapore staying here at the mercure singapore on stevens the absolute best service of any hotel iv experienced around the world the staff are so helpful and accommodating to our every need if you want a great hotel experience then my advice is stay here its a great location its new comfortable luxurious and very reasonably priced fabulous bars and restaurants onsite x awesome pools drinks and snacks available poolside hour extemely helpful concierge and hour room service iv given this hotel and its staff and service stars but if i could give it stars i would i cannot recommend it highly enough and its now my singapore home cannot wait till next time i didnt want to leave a special shout out and
1523,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,short stay booked a night for short staycation and was wonderful and value for money room is well design making it look spacious cosy and comfortable fast check in and check out with lost of movement in lobby due to airline crews could have a separate counter for crews to check in and check out will definitely come back again if have the chance
1524,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,great customer service nice facilities really loved the great customer service on site the front desk people were really friendly and the operator was really responsive the facilities were nice we visited the pool and i will say it is really great the room is rather small as expected of many hotel rooms anywhere however they have all the things i will ever need for my stay i like the layout of the room as well as it looks extra cozy the only two things i was not satisfied was the minibar and the bed i didnt quite expect it to be that small as the description suggested queen bed i understand the minibar in the room is meant to keep items in a cool temperature but the very few items we put became warm instead cleanliness wise everything is not too bad just some specks of dust in some corners but the
1525,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,rooms are very small but comfy this was my first time staying in this hotel the rooms are super small and so its the bathroom but the bed is very comfortable amd huge and its basically the size of the room there is no table in the room so if you order room service you have to eat on your bed or there is this side sofa otherwise room is clean and ac is working perfectly and there is no annoying sound so thumb up for this also my room was in the end of the hallway and was super quiet but i would not recommend ordering room service as this was the biggest disappointment i ordered salad from the room service menus it was vegetarian so i asked to add the chicken breast and the lady told me it will be additional soi agreed as i thought it will be proper portion what was the surprise when
1526,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,first time mercure very near to orchard road good eateries just nearybyit was a deluxe room with the most comfortable double bed than many other hotels in singapore i could rest well with no noise pollution truly an amazing place to be cleanliness was on point
1527,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good hotel friendly staff but away from mrt stations we had booked rooms in v bencoolen in singapore as it was quite centrally located however being highly disappointed with that one we had to cancel it and look for something in the last minute thats when this was one of the hotels available we were initially reluctant to book this one as it is a little away from the city centre but went ahead as we had only a few options but this hotel turned out to be quite good and we got a warm welcome too it has almost all the basic facilities that one would need the staff is friendly too the lobby and the rooms were sparkling clean looked like it was recently built we had initially booked it for two days but later extended our stay in the hotel as we found the stay really pleasant infact on the first two days they also
1528,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,needs improvement first time staying wont recommend it hotel room is so small even the bathroom there are hardly any space to fit your belongings the hotel buffet breakfast is one of the worst i have been to for a singapore standard hotel the selection of choices was so limited i actually question myself did i actually have breakfast the only good thing i can say about the hotel is that there is a nice cafe located just opposite the lobby and few restaurants outside the hotel i dont recommend eating at hotel this hotel isnt far from orchard road but again apart from that there isnt much around
1529,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,friendly and attentive staffs comfortable rooms i stayed at mercure on stevens for couple of times and i must say both times did not disappoint the staffs are friendly helpful and very attentive they are accommodating too the room is just what i needed very comfortable for a solo traveler or couples i was upgraded the privilege room on my first visit and i was loving it easy access to orchard as it is walking distance or if youre not in the mood to walk theres shuttle too the curry gardenn restaurant in front of the hotel is a must try too highly recommended
1530,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,シンガポール居住経験者にとって快適 筆者は外国居住が長くシンガポールにも住んだ経験がありますその上での評価です まあまあの料金で快適な滞在ができるホテルです 部屋小さいがキレイで快適 ロケーションすばらしく良いオーチャードエリアから路線バスですぐの場所にあります主要高速道路のpieが近いのでタクシー利用でのシンガポール国内の移動に便利ですそれでいて緑が多く静かなエリア高級住宅街です 食べ物レストランは使っていませんが一階で売っているサンドイッチはヨーロッパ的でとてもおいしい コインランドリー泊したのでコインランドリーがあることはありがたかったです 全体として満足のいく宿泊でした 以下英語です i am satisfied with this confortable stay room the room was small but clean and cozy location the location is superb just a few bus stops from orchaed area very near to pie but in green and quiet area food i did not use restaurants but sandwiches i purchased at f are very tasty i like these european styled sandwiches launderette i stayed nights so that the launderette is quite useful overall very satisfactory
1531,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,a new hotel that was perfect for my needs as a singaporean who lives in melbourne now i rarely need to stay in a hotel as i usually stay with my son in my recent trip to singapore my daughter and her family were staying as well so i decided to stay in a hotel close by the mercure was an ideal minute walk from my son and being an accor member it was an obvious choice for me as an original member of the old pinetree club it was nice to be staying in a hotel on the same site as i spent most of my time out of the hotel i didnt use the facilities but my room was very well maintained and cleaned daily i appreciated fresh bottles of water everyday the room was a little on the small side but again as i was alone and spending little time in the room it didnt bother me the staff were very friendly and helpful
1532,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,comfortable stay while many reviewers commented that the room is small i find that it is just right for guests the beds are comfortable and i slept well there are a number of tv channels that cater to different interests too free shuttle service is provided to transport guests to orchard road for shopping spree other than that the hotel is surrounded by private properties as i prefer to stay indoor i really do not mind that there is little entertainment near the hotel unlike many mercure hotels that i have stayed this hotel does not serve welcome drinks to accorhotel members this is fine with me as i guess hotels may have different policies
1533,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,friendly staff who go the extra mile im new to singapore and travelling on a whole i got lost trying to navigate to the paragon and did not have any access to the internet when i came in to ask for directionsyour reception manager jj was not only helpful in steering me back on track but she also lent me her personal hotspot so i could contact my friends without her suggestions we would have missed out on the great food at golden mile and the vibrant nightlife outside of vivocity definitely coming to stay here the next time i visit singapore great effort
1534,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,ecellent nice area nearby orchard rd hotel got free public transportation to orchard area all area is always clean and the lobby also convenient for tea or coffee around hotel got paparich and seafood stall friendly staffs providing information hrs
1535,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great stay they know how to treat their guest with great gesture of hospitality would like to commend the front desk officers for being so accomodating breakfast is also goodvariety of selections shuttle to orchard rd is also on time also it pays to be an accor plus member
1536,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,good new hotel a bit off the track stayed here for one night rooms are ok bigger for similar hotels in singapore but not big enough for my taste comes with all inroom amenities staff is friendly didnt have breakfast location is close to orchard roadscotts rd but wasnt too convenient def not walking distance would rather choose another location next time
1537,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,a bit close to shopping area the hotel is good inspite the fact that the rooms are just enough space for a two person i consider it as a star hotel since they have some aminities that are not available such as steam sauna which i love to do after a long haul flight but over all its good location and sorrounding area are perfect
1538,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,below what a mercure can offer this hotel was built with the intention of being ibis in the beginning and was sort of rebranded into mercure ive stayed and seen in a couple of mercure around the region and in terms of room size it is definitely small which is comparable to ibis anywhere it doesnt even fit a desk no wardrobe in the room and hangers are just above the coffee tea amenties during check in front desk staff jj returned the credit card and identity card by slapping almost throwing it on the table top this is probably not the most polite thing to do even though it was pretty busy during check in generally cleanliness is all good for a new hotel but surprisingly some paint tear on doors can be seen buffet spread at food exchange level is quite good specially the cheese and
1539,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great place to stay great place to stay staff are all friendly and were very helpful the hotel is different to novotel even tho they are together our room abit small but okay for us as we were out most of the time free shuttle bus to orchard road or stevens train station mrt our breakfast was supplied with our booking cant fault it basically all you can eat will stay at this hotel again
1540,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,mercure on steven orchard such as a platinum accor member this is very recommended hotel to stay new hotel good price and close to orchard they upgrade me to the suite room and free access to the lounge free breakfast i already stay there for several times and always have a great experience with mercure and novotel on steven orchard
1541,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,simply superb satisfied unlimited personalized service enjoying relaxing best the reviews title told it all had a superb stay cation with great service comprehensive facilities and good meals the hotel is modern and chic it has a lap and infinity swimming pool and a big gym one would never feel bore as theres always something one can do including shopping which a free shuttle service to nearby mall is provided also one would never feel hungry as one would be spoilt for foods choice with couple of f b outlets around the vicinity including hotels restaurants specially mentioned and applaud the following staff for their great service they were friendly accommodating attentive to details and served with passion and smiles certainly an asset to the organisation they are matthieu lucia sales neo yuan shan banquet candice qian
1542,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,small rooms but good hotel the rooms are small but very well done and modern the closet space if shared with the coffee essentials and the mini bar yes despite the small size there is still a mini bar there is no work desk which may be a disadvantage to those who intend get some work done location is a bit of challenge because it is a bit of a hike from most popular places like orchard road km and newton food center km there is a free shuttle bus though to orchard road that runs every half hour till very late overall though it is a wonderful hotel
1543,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,clean modern hotel here for a couple of nights the hotel is nice very modern and extremely clean as its a non smoking hotel they have designated certain areas for the smokers this is nice for the smokers and non smokers alike the room has everything you would need in the room safe fridge iron and a nice flat screen tv on the wall the only thing i can say negatively about the room is that its pretty small so if you are looking to have a nice spacious room this isnt the hotel for you for me it was ok as im only here to sleep in the room and i only need a corner for my suitcase and a nice comfortable bed to sleep in and mercury delivered on this the gym is well equipped with a good selection of machines to get a decent work out in they offer two pools to swim laps or just chill in
1544,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good i been stay there frequently this time feel not so friendly from staffs benefits that i suppose to get but not all overall is good room is clean not much choices for breakfast not valuable for price
1545,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great staff the staff service was excellent reception staff is very friendly and concierge is knowledgeable i give them all five star the hotel have a shuttle bus service to and from ochard road and a minutes walk to mrt station great restaurants and bar around
1546,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,tiny rooms i just dont like this place rooms are extremely tiny if you make an effort you can touch both the pillow with your head and the tv screen with your toes considering the price this room is not even ibis level bathroom is insanely small no words staff are very plain and not really approachable location is just nothing special paying a central price for a location that still needs quite of a walk to reach the end of orchard rd pool just ok hotel from the same chain next to it is better but still more expensive and not in a good location disappointed
1547,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,lovely hotel very new hotel location was a little awkward close to orchard area but not within walking distance they do have shuttles to the mrt station rooms are a little small but they are well appointed and are userfriendly with usb charging points conveniently located in the rooms staff are really lovely friendly and helpful special mentions must go to shah and remy who made our stay so special and went out of their way to welcome us and made us feel at home thank you
1548,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,very small room we stayed here for four nights and found the room to be very small it was rather uncomfortable for two persons the bathroom was like a small cubicle on the other hand the room was very new and the bed was clean and comfortable there were a few restaurants on the ground floor of the hotel however there are no food center or other dining outlets available nearby
1549,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,clean and comfortable new hotel i stayed for one night with my wife and kids i arrived quite late around pm but the check in process quite fast the room was standard not big but also not too small it has comfortable bed but having no sofa bed it has free rides to dfs on scotts road every hour as well as return back to the hotel
1550,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,one of the poorest accor hotels lobby appearance looks great as a platinum member was told it was a quality room on th floor my to my surprise on entering the room so tiny one large bed took up most floor space no hanging closet only a couple of hangers over the coffee making area the bed on one side nearly touching wall no shelf for luggage or placing clothes so need put on floor bathroom so tiny bad luck for ladies no room for make up bag so tiny open bathroom door cant open room entry door this i believe is ibis standard not mercure but the owner insisted it be a mercure it adjoins a novotel hotel i am sure same owner rest room on ground level is shared by both hotels maybe the novotel is mercure standard after first night i complained about the lack of space to front office and they said they would
1551,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,quiet room with great location we were booked for nights after nights stay next door at the novotel early july i understood that they are under the same management but between the hotels both hubby and i prefer the mercure it is a buzzing place full of activity at the lobby but once you get to the room on the th floor all that escapes you we were lucky that we did not have any disturbances throughout the nights and preferred the flooring at the mercure as it was wooden and not carpet novotel and mercure share the same amenities ie the gym pools restaurant i have only used the lap pool near the gym and found that pretty good away from guests with families overall we would not hesitate to recommend the hotel there is a shuttle bus to take you opposite far east plaza but we walked to
1552,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,mercure on stevens an oasis away from the hustle and bustle i have now been travelling for over years and had written many reviews on tripadvisor and post them as accurately as i can and no i do not get paid in anyway for these reviews i also try to make my reviews constructive and make suggestions for improving the customers experience check in experience including recognition of the status of the hotel guest i booked this property because it was newly built and close to orchard road initially i booked the orchard grand court which is in a better location and have now revamped their rooms on arrival we were greeted by a friendly check in agent and advised us that we had been upgraded to the privilege floor that is the th floor with no access to the privilege lounge i booked the room through the accor website as
1553,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,staycation my wife and i visited this hotel for our staycation it was a peak season so weve waited for minutes just to get our room it was my wife who went to the front desk to ask if our room is ready because we felt they forgot us already as other guest also started to complain everything in the room was nice and clean bed was comfy have a strong wifi and we had a good night sleep when we went to our breakfast buffet our name was not included for the complimentary breakfast so we went to front desk and they immediately settled the issue overall it was a nice stay just need to improve their services especially during peak season
1554,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,clean bu noisy it was nice hotel the service was good too but the room was small the bad thing that to much chinese tourists made so much noise they were screaming and yelling in the hall way in the early morning start at am and loud voices at midnight too so my husband and i never had a good rest over there
1555,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice hotel not so near orchard mercure stevens considered as new hotel in singapore very clean and staffs were friendly things to considered if you use public transport the nearest mrt station is stevens mrt but you still need to take bus to get to this hotel and if its rainy season you have to always bring your umbrella since you need to walk in open air from the bus stop in front of the hotel stops from stevens mrt and stops to far east plaza orchard the standard room considered small same with many other hotels in singapore the staffs were all friendly but they didnt let me take home the room access card i usually take it home as souvenir hahahaha
1556,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,brand new hotel the hotel must have built not just renovated less than a year ago the rooms are relatively small as expected from hotels in singapore and it has its hiccups however the staff and particularly the duty manager have the authority to put things right and in the hospitality business people are the most valuable resource good job
1557,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,comfort zone we managed to strike a good deal on the accommodation and decided to without thinking twice later only we found out the location is not that convenient but still accessible when we arrived the hotel looks grand and its next to novotel very busy reception area as people were checking in and out at the same time however they only had staff on duty maybe its due to the raya holiday as our room was not ready we decided to wait at the lobby found out that they also accommodate the crew for emirates airline at pm we were allowed to check into our room the room is small but very clean the bed is very comfortable the toilet is also very clean overall the room size is just nice for people if you are only using the room for a nights sleep as theres no table
1558,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,lovely hotel my father and i stayed here for two nights and enjoyed the facilities in the hotel while the room was well appointed spotlessly clean and the beds comfortable it was also tiny and very cramped with two of us with luggage we were on our way from australia to europe for a month there is very limited storage and hanging space for clothing breakfast was good with a variety of food and we appreciated being able to use the shower facilities in the gym to change when we arrived early in the morning before check in was available the staff were all helpful and the hotel is in a fairly good location it is a min walk to the mrt station which was fine and taxis are also easily available and cheap
1559,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,new and close to orchard road accessible by bus stops from stevens mrt or bus stops from orchard mrt close to orchard road but away from the crowds mercure singapore on stevens share the same property with novotel singapore on stevens both under accor also sharing available hotel facilities such as the pool gym and its myriad of fb options rooms are slightly on a smaller side the slimmer side table top was loose and the full flush button in the toilet did not seem to work one of the bedside usb port didnt work either else there was no other issues with the room the room was clean with high ceilings and full glass windows there is no work desk but a lounge chair with foot rest by the window the hotel seems to house many airline crews and also families with young children overall a
1560,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good hotel but you must like kids being everywhere a good hotel that is part of the mercurenovotel complex that share the same facilities you cant fault the service food and surrounding restaurants my biggest problem with this hotel is screaming noisy kids everywhere running through the corridors at pm disrupting anyone who wants a little piece at the lap pool its kids kids and more kids this may sound grumpy but you just cant get any quiet time here the lap pool should be designated adults only otherwise what is the point of a lap pool when you cant actually do laps for kids messing about other minor irritation is a poor choice of breakfast cereal rice crispies chocolate rice crispies cornflakes and bran wheres the adult cereal like granola and mueslistandard in most hotels the premixed muesli served
1561,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,new modern and compact newly opened mecure hotel sits in a small compound adjoined with novotel and a variety of restaurants the hotel staff are welcoming the rooms clean and compact however the bathroom is tiny and uncomfortable to move around in the gym is great and the hotel also has a lap pool and tennis court a free shuttle to botanical gardens and orchid street shopping area is provided which is necessary as its not on a mrt link and in a quieter residential area ive marked down my score as the in room dining is not good at all limited option no singaporean dish on offer the quality isnt good either ive had both the beef bulgogi and chicken curry and both cuts of meat were cheap and overcooked unfortunately other than that a great stay i will stay here again for work in future
1562,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good affordable new hotel mercure singapore on stevens is a newly opened hotel on stevens street my first impression was down to earth lobby smooth check in friendly and helpful staffs hotel is located on a residential area there was not shopping center nor mrt station closed by good trade off for good quiet sleep however there was a couple of decent restaurants nearby the room was quite new clean comfortable king sized bed small but adequate however the restroom was too small for me there was a free breakfast served at the place called winestone restaurant food there was not much variety but will filled you up
1563,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,short city stay in singspore central location new hotel within easy reach of orchard road frequent shuttle bus to city daily room a bit small but clean for the price you pay breakfast not included staffs friendly and helpful
1564,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,down to earth friendly and helpful staffs though this mercure hotel is relatively new i must say the service have been very constant we used to stay in another place for our layover but now we are placed here i am with an airline and i must say the staffs that handle all the matters pertaining to crews are efficient and swift i must say my thanks to shah he handled crews matters with care and concern there are also few other staffs which unfortunately i was unable to remember the names some people go lengths to assist and help and that is much appreciated would also like to say a very huge continuous thank yous to the bellman like amir jack and daniel they have been so helpful to carry my suitcase into the taxi i truly felt so bad as most times my suitcase can be pretty full and heavy they sometimes

1567,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,family stacation newly opened hotel with new concept mercure and novotel are actually joined to make a larger hotel by combining facilities we had three rooms and by the new standards are smallish but functional we checked in without problems using the internet however did observe that at certain times the lobby was very crowded as i understand groups heading for cruise ships use this hotel the staff are helpful and obliging there are no shops unless you take a free shuttle bustaxi or walk to orchard rd breakfast which came with our room as good the hotel tries to be child friendly by having a small kids playroom complete with xbox and some games this child friendly policy does however not extend to a food menus catering to small kids even room service does not include food items to
1568,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,quick business visit great hotel warm greetings and arrived at pm but checked in was unfortunately delayed till pm probably due to delayed of house keeping or some miscommunications room was clean and cosy love the high level bed super awesome breakfast hotel staff was very helpful in searching for grabubertaxi will definitely come back again also walking distance to orchard road great location

1570,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,pleasant stay hotels location abit out of the way checking in and check out was a breeze polite and efficient my only gripe is that rooms are tinyno wardrobe space i have been told that they have bigger rooms at a higher costbut that makes it too expensieve
1571,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,quick business visit the mercure hotel on stevens is close to the botanical gardens and the area has a more suburban feel to it as it is slightly away from the central business area as such it leaves one more tranquil and have a great home away from home feel to it the mrt metro or underground station is basically a block away and therefore the hotel is very conveniently connected to the rest of singapore as well and obviously taxis are convenient relatively cheap and also available rooms as a bit small anyway the one i got but as i stayed only one night that was not an issue you have a choice of a number of excellent restaurants catering for almost all tastes within the hotel complex staff were friendly the property clean and well maintained with all the amenities you
1572,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,great hotel great hotel with a nice infinity pool and lap pool it also has an awesome gym the staff were very friendly and helpful the food was great too its proximity to orchard was a big advantage as well it had a free shuttle bus going to and from orchard is great as well the free wifi was good as there was no limit to the number of devices per room
1573,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,nice but noisy hotel in general is nice newly equipped and clean but absolutely inconvenient when you need to stay overnight and rest you can hear the housekeeping even after pm as their vacuum cleaners hit the furniture
1574,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice hotel adjacent with novotel sg on stevens these hotels are located behind orchard but in the residential area this makes our stay become peaceful as it is quiet new hotel with high technology such as tv with bluetooth and speakers

1582,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good facilities and location good standard of facilities and services as expected from this chain rooms are quite small but no smaller than whats normal in singapore for me the location was good as its a short bus ride to orchard road and there are good bus links to other places of interest as well the bus stops are just outside and opposite the hotel the nearest mrt stevens is only about minutes walk away also they have free shuttle services that take you close to orchard road but the timing was never right for me the pool shared with novotel next door looked great and i regret that i didnt have the chance to try it i would have liked to have the handy phone with free data and local calls which is useful for tourists who dont want to have to roam or buy a local sim especially great
1583,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,joyful awesome clean and kind service except for tiny room everything was awesome staffs were friendly facilities were new and clean and food was also good even though it was my first time to visit singapore i had a good impression during my stay

1592,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,new hotel but small room this hotel is less than months ago and is in the same compound of novotel hotel on stevens i was told that both hotels are under the same management it is in the private residential area and bus stops away from the busy shopping street orchard road the nearest mrt station is steven station which is to minutes walk the hotel provides half hourly free shuttle bus to and fro t galleria dfs its superior room is very small which has no writing table free wifi is available in all the rooms bed is very comfortable water pressure in the bath room is not strong staff are very friendly and helpful i was offered late checkout because i am accor plus member i never had such offer in the past while i stayed in other accor hotels the hotel has the outdoor
1593,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,modern new hotel this is a fairly new hotel situated in a good location close to orchard rd scott rd and offers a free shuttle every minutes which was very convenient the rooms are small but very clean and well equipped with amenities the hotel has a pool and tennis court if you are so inclined the breakfast was very good with a wide selection of dishes hot cold asian and western and all cooked well one of the standouts of this hotel were the staff all of which we interacted with were friendly professional and will to help us with anything especially raz in the lounge all of which are a credit to the accor group
1594,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,beautiful new hotel convenient location we love staying at accor hotels and this one did not disappointthe hotel has been well planned with eyecatching contemporary interior design located in a leafy suburb it is an easy minute walk to the stevens mrt station giving you convenient cheap and efficient access to almost any other singapore location the staff were very welcoming and the standard of service high the room is quite small only marginally bigger then a typical cruise ship cabin but very clean and comfortable if youve stayed at an ibis hotel youll have an idea of the room size my guess is that the building was originally designed as an ibis hotel but at sometime during construction they decided to go more upmarket and equip the rooms to the mercure standard
1595,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,the hotel is ok but the rooms are extremely ridicously small impossible to spend more than night in one of these rooms i was with my wife two luggage could not open them the bathroom is even smaller than a closet consider carefully the dimensions of the rooms before booking
1596,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,new hotel the hotel was quite new surrounding by several restaurantpapa rich japanese rest indian rest long beach the lobby was nice quite busy everyday many airline companies stayed at this hotel the rooms are small but luckily they provide all the things that i need big swimming pool big led tv and they even have a tennis court they also provide free shuttle every half an hour to dfs galleria orchard
1597,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,i was fine for night but so elegant and new staff are very friendly and professional access to basic gym basic pool and a nice tennis court no balconies every thing is small and well designed but bathrooms should have been a bit bigger you hit your head in the glass divider when squatting on the toilet seat am am i developing claustrophobic symptoms or the rooms are tiny
1598,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,nice and comfortable amazing place to stay with the prices stayed here quite frequent and always been helped by the stuff to explore singapore thank again to mralam shah for the helped and warm staylooking forward to come here and explore morecheers
1599,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,fantastic stay we stayed here as a couple for nights in a deluxe double room on the th floor we found the staff at reception and the porters to be very helpful and friendly the service was second to none danieal was very good to deal with the hotel lobby has a café counter which did excellent coffee and there are also computers for use with free internet access there is a very comfortable hotel bar adjacent which is technically part of the novotel there are swimming pools for use and a well equipped gym the room itself was clean and comfortable and we had a free minibar as we had paid for a deluxe room there was a safe and a coffee machine also there was minimal noise from street level although we were on the top floor of the building to be fair it is worth noting that
1600,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good hotel but not business hotel its a new hotel i stayed there days for business the room is small and there is no desk for work internet good service good breakfast good swimming pool and gym also good this hotel is at the same complex as novotel on stevens i stayed thee before and recommend to stay in novotel if you come for business
1601,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,handy to orchard rd mercure on stevens is a newly built hotel close to orchard rd and stevens mrt station rooms are clean and well furnished but on the small side staff are friendly and efficient and an excellent buffet breakfast is availablesome facilities are shared with the adjoining novotel hotel
1602,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,good hospitality its new and clean gym room was not bad i stay here for times during the business tripmr shah and mr raz was very nice friendly they even share a lot of tips for look around in singapore everytime enter the hotel mr scott will using the friendly and warmly smile for welcome us even the cleaner was very kind and friendly they have wonderful hospitality team it was a great stay although the room are small but for business trip is enough
1603,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hospitality loved this hotel its new and so comfortable rooms are clean and well equipped the pool area is very pretty loved the design and convenience of this hotel food is great stuff in the hotel very helpful and polite shopping area is close only min walking or few min by shuttle bus i stayed here for only one night and i am coming back soon could easily imagine staying longer i must say that mr shah was very helpful to me and my colleagues during our stay thank you all
1604,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,a helping hand i was in singapore for work only for days but injured myself and had to be there for longer the hotel was exceptionally helpful and attentive to my needs and my situation the reception department helped me through out my stay with wheelchairstaxisvisits to the hospital and what not room service staff were kind enough to help me out while my movement was very restrictive unfortunately during such phase i was unable to memorize any names however i would like to extend my big thank you to the tremendously hardworking diligent and refined staff of the relatively new hotel even though the rooms in the hotel are quite small the people working there sure have a big heart
1605,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,weekend staycation it was a great stay the guestroom was nicely decorated with the basic guest amenities we had dinner at winestone where we were attended to by bernie and his team kudos to bernie for his excellent service the mediterranean food was nice especially the hummus and falafel i would also like to extend my complements to concierge usop he bade me farewell upon my departure and asked if i needed assistance with transportation i politely declined but it was thoughtful of him to offer for a comfortable stay with wonderful hospitality from the team check out this brand new hotel located off orchard road at stevens road shuttle bus services bring you to the shopping belt where retail therapy awaits
1606,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,comfortable stay interestingly hotels under this hotel group give guests a choice for a comfortable stay both share the same driveway but have separate entrances located off the main shopping belt guests are still be able to get their retail fix by hopping on to their shuttle buses checkin was fast and efficient and daniel did a great job for his thoroughness in explaining the services and facilities available as there are no queue poles it would be good though if team members behind the counter acknowledged the guests in the queue to inform them they are next in line facilities are shared and guests from both hotels are free to patronise the food and beverage outlets in either hotel and use the respective hotels facilities such as the pools the guestroom we were assigned to
1607,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,grand stay new mercure on stevens the prices from perth stayed two nights prior booking in for nights at grand hyatt to celebrate our th wedding anniversary but the service at the hyatt was so poor we returned to the mercure to complete our stay in singapore the staff and service at the mercure especially scott at reception was fantastic we also had access to the novotel privilege room which was the highlight of our stay raz and visha provided service you would expect at a star hotel we will be back and telling all our family and friends about the newest and best value for money hotel in singapore well done accor and the team at mercurenovotel on stevens
1608,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,good all was ok hotel brand new maybe room a little bit small with no wardrobe good breakfast convenient location taxi available service ok restaurant together with hotel at the end it is very good
1609,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,clean fresh hotel minimalist with shuttle services to orchard road eventhough the room felt rather small but clean with new scent fresh like novotel on stevens it has shuttle services from the hotel to orchard road and back every thirty minutes until the last one at at night eventhough has been graded as stars hotel like novotel but the interior is rather simple and not as luxurious as novotel but the interior design at the lobby is artistic quite nice going up through the lift with a key tapped to the area indicated for security equipped with infinity swimming pool
1610,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,great hotel for a short stay we stayed in this hotel on the way to melacca for one night the hotel is well situated for orchard rd the botanic gardens and newton circus the service in the hotel was excellent as was the restaurant food at breakfast the only reason the hotel is not more highly rated is the shortage of clothes storage which is why we would not stay here for more than one or two nights
1611,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,frustrating night experience i am compelled to write this review having already given feedback via accor hotels automated request following my stay that resulted in an irritating email from the property manager which didnt address the problems at all i stayed here for nights as an accor plus member and was disappointed with my experience for a number of reasons ill save the best till last firstly i was given a room with disabled washroom facilities this was inconvenient since it means you cant stand under the shower due to a bench fixed underneath it it also means that water floods the entire bathroom floor for the rest of the evening the manager in his response to me claimed i requested a room close to the lift and that was the only room available a feeble excuse secondly due to
1612,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,excellent service checkin a very warm welcome by shah roomcleancomfy bednew furnish foodmenu choices could be better service shah was very attentive and knowledgeable great suggestions on what to do nearby the vicinity helped us understand whats in the surrounding it was really nice of him because we like to hear what the local have to say we managed to save some money on transportation with the shuttle van provided suggestions would be nice if bugis is added as a shuttle stop as well all in all our stay was really pleasant and we cant wait to come back to this place although the location of the hotel isnt really strategic but the people working there made a difference and we were happy with our stay thank you so much shah and everyone else in mecure
1613,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,consistently great service first time staying at mercure on stevens great service all round and really look after accor platinum members variety of excellent dining options particularly strong service from the lady short hair on the sides that greets you in the upper floor restaurant at breakfast many excellent dining options inhouse although not much available within a short walk from the hotel rooms are small yet well appointed however this in singapore a bit away from orchard road yet shuttle bus is available
1614,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,singapore stay the room was a bit smaller than expected but then we didnt spend much time in it only for sleeping the priviledge facilities were excellent indeed but again we did not make good use of these facilities it will be great once the mercure ahs their own facility and not sharing with novotel the cleanliness of the room was a little below the expected standard as well
1615,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,stay at mercure was in handicapped room cos my mum is on wheelchair the bed is far too high not easy to get up staff couldnt offer any solution for it room is small and crampfood available all around with good variety
1616,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,new hotel the hotel is still smell new of furniture unfortunately i just disappointed with the room the rooms are small for star hotel even for bathroom extremely small i cant turn around in bathroom i have to hit the glass if i turn around
1617,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,grest location free shuttle to orchard road and singapore botanic gardens hotel on stevens is about few minutes from orchard and shopping center convenient public transport and a bus stop right at the hotel doorstep new modern room and comfortable bed with free wifi breakfast spread id good hotel staff are friendly and helpful
1618,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,an excellent business and leisure choice mercure hotel on stevens is a fantastic new hotel located in the same premises as novotel hotel the hotel is chic amazing decor and overall is very aesthetically pleasing the hotel has excellent seating facility for business delegates the breakfast menu has some delectable choices for vegetarians overall the hotel is a fantastic choice for all business and leisure travellers considering a central stay option in singapore
1619,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,very polite staff recommended i was staying here from feb with my son first our room was small then i spoke with ms na and she upgraded me to a bigger room i requested an extra bed and when i checked out i was assisted by ms anne she told me i do not have to pay for anything it is was compliments from the hotel i was really gretaful for all of these things very excellent service and good staff nice breakfast even though little selection reasonable price running water not strong enough walk to the mrt station takes more than mins not so close to the city or shopping area
1620,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,we expected more when we travel we love staying at mercure hotels and heard this one is new and close to town thats what lady told us at the airport and done the booking for us unfortunately it wasnt that close to town as we been told room for two double bed was very small not enough space to unpack or even hand things coffee cups wasnt washed properly we could see teacoffee stains on the bottom of the cups kettle was dusty and i felt like bathroom wasnt clean enough as there was stains on the sink and mirrors no tissues also not sure how it all works but it just takes way to long we return about pm to hotel and bought xquick noodle soup from the packet at their buffetbar hungry and tired we waited till the lady at the reception print the receipt and as we left to catch
1621,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,layover excellent very friendly staff new and bright hotel i liked my room very much comfortable big bed corridors are quiet nothing building anywhere around all you need for the good rest i ordered salmon lasagna it was amazing and not expensive
1622,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice enough hotel the reception staff are very friendly and organised taxis to the office for me with no problems rooms are nice enough very minimal modern and clean the mercure hotel was perfectly fine for my business trip
1623,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,great hotel lovely amenities and fantastic neighbourhood stayed for a conference first time in singapore loved the hotel new clean and spacious rooms with good amenities pool area is lovely restaurant very good location is excellent within easy walking distance of nus located by the botanical gardens arrived at noon sticky and hot from the metro ride and walk from airport and pleasant staff checked me in early highly recommend
1624,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,peter service staff very efficient my room kettle was not working properly the staff come very fast he checked and replace the kettle well done the check in is very fast and easy the staff is very friendly and helpful she explained everything very clearly for example where to have welcome drinks and where to have breakfast good job
1625,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,a long weekend away we pop to singapore from brunei a least once a year and look for the best deals this a brand new hotel little out of the way but dont be put off staff were great at all levels rooms comfortable and spotlessly clean good range of east and west foods for breakfast the new complex has good restaurants so you can just pop next door o and our bed had the best mattress i have ever slept on at any hotel ever well done mercure on stevens see you again soon
1626,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,a comfortable stopover we had a night here enroute to other places everything was fine after an initial mixup with our room that was sorrted the rooms are compact but with everything you need we enjoyed using the gym and swimming pool the breakfast selection was also good
1627,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,nice brand new hotel brand new hotel friendly staff nice pools gym shared with novotel very good and diverse breakfast rooms are new modern comfortable but a bit small no desk for bigger rooms add sgd and upgrade to novotel
1628,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,rooms a little small and some staff need customer service training overall it was a mixed experience during our stay at mercure on stevens yes i can agree with most travellers that room size its an issue here sqm or so it feels a bit compressed and with huge luggage it becomes a real space problem bed and bathroom itself was ok and provides anything you need as we were most of the time outdoors it wasnt that troublesome for us however i have also to highlight that some of the staff seriously lacking hospitality skillsattention and customer service check in raihan gary breakfast and bartender indianmalayin bar at novotel more interested watching rodeo riding on tv bartender are entertainer and hosts and make it a lively place breakfast itself was average ok at am staff struggle to refill all items on buffetonly one jam
1629,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,gave two for the breakfast found ants in my room when i was leaving the room informed the reception they told me thanks for informing us thats it no sorry no apology customer service is zero i was so surprised breakfast the guy who guided me to my table was forcing me to sit next to a window where the sun was so strong refused to sit there he changed my seat to a table where there is no salt and pepper nthg only cutlery and tissue well i moved my table found the waitress avoiding eye contact when asked for anything the reaction is scared face they are lacking customer service and training
1630,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,this hotel is really just a private hostel never never again i know this hotel is new but it was an absolute disaster from check in to check out the worst offense of the hotel cannot be changed the size of the hallway and rooms i just realized this is basically a private hostel my first time in a hostel hoorah if you happen to have two suitcases you cannot wheel them down the hallway to your room because the hallway is not wide enough see pics this alone shows an absolute lack of basic human decency towards guests to save money in design construction this may sound odd but ignore book and youll see the rooms are ummm hmm they can fit a bed table hard as rock cheap chair and thats about it the bed was comfortable at least but no heat and it was cold the bathroom was small but ok a very high cheap toilet
1631,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,1,last option for next booking i have to wait around minutes for check in the room is not spacious you can get more space on novotel room nearby with the same price when we went back to the room after tiring travel around pm we found that there is electricity problem in our room and we went back to receptionist to wait for mins
1632,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,very basics rooms are really compact to the international standards keeping one suitcase also in a task amenities tea kettle with teacoffee stores are good mini bar stacked only room size is a big problem even the toilet showers could feel claustrophobic
1633,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,beautiful smiles and very good breakfast spread nice new hotelit was nice feeling to be greeted with nice welcoming smiles after a tiring flight especially raz who checked my crews in he was very engaging with the crews and was answering all the crews queries brilliantly and also i was pleasantly surprised by the varieties of choices at the breakfast buffetthe hr gym is also a wonderful addition to the hotel and the pool looks so inviting i m so looking forward for my future stay at the mercure stevens
1634,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,very new cosy hotel friendly staff the rooms are small but very cosy with all the appropriate modern facilities the gym is quite big with a lot of equipment the room service menu is basic and i was told by many of my colleagues not to bother with food at the hotel uber eats is an option if you want something more substantial downtown singapore only mins by taxi
1635,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,2,just ok one of the worst room size i ever experienced in the hotels the rooms are super super cramped if you are a couple then rooms seems to be crowed bathroom is even worst if you open your hands wide open your one hand has to be out of the bathroom room service menu is very small and sometimes the items are not available i wouldnt recommend this to anyone unless you are too desperate to find room in this area and no choice left
1636,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,3,average this is a brand new hotel by accor along stevens road which is a posh residential area in singapore it is easily accessible with taxi good brand new excellent bed quality helpful staffs bad small space which i mistaken it as ibis poor wifi which disconnected every mins limited choice of food nearby i would recommend this if the price offered reasonable
1637,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,new hotel new rooms new everything we booked this hotel because we had a complimentary night by accor hotel membership we heard this hotel was new so we figured why not to our delight this hotel is great at almost everything the staff were delightful checkinout was a breeze and the rooms are spacious with great beds since this is a new hotel its no shock that everything was still brand new one thing that stands out is the ac it was the coldest ive ever felt in a hote room many restaurants near the hotel is a major plus for me
1638,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,4,still smells new this is a brand new hotel still has the new smell and you can see they are still finishing the final touches the rooms are small but functional everything has its place and it works well the bathroom is small with very little space to place your things love the light fitting the shower has good water pressure the staff are all pleasant and go out of the way to make you feel welcome make use of the shuttle to orchard road it makes the hotel more convenient food and beverage options are still limited but you can see they are working on it
1639,Mercure Singapore On Stevens Singapore,5,very good value for the price its a new hotel just ten min walk from orchard road but you can also take the free shuttle that departs every thirty min free parking and a bus stop just in front of the hotel nearest mrt is stevens which is five min walk away room and bathroom are small but pretty and comfortable sound proofing is not great we can hear some of the sounds from the corridor and of door closing gym is very well equipped and there are two pools alap pool and an infinity pool both are not huge but there are situated away from each other so you still feel like theres privacy theres a kids club but its just some swivel chair and tv breakfast is awesome a very good spread with very good quality and this is no mean feat for singapore standards service is good everyone seems
1640,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,a nightmare hotel the hotel is like a market place and they dont have personal touch with their guests they clean your room only when you pressure them and make noise i have stayed there for nights and my room was cleaned only once after going mad on them not good for holidares who wants to feel good and enjoy it fits business people who are extremely very busy without being keen on what is going on living very early and coming back very late i cant recomend it for family very small rooms that cant feet fit your suitcases well so depressing and frastrustrating not worth the money value even no sugar to make youself coffee like other hotels
1641,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,thank you to mr ryan yee when i landed before my friends and wanted to explore the city a bit i went to reception to ask about best places to eat and explore mr yee was kind enough to help me out with all my questions and requests thank you
1642,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,just awful not only is the room tiny but there isnt any cupboard storage teacoffee provisions or cups cutlery etc it is a bare bones room just a bed and a bathroom the bathroom exhaust fan cover had black mould growing on it the bathroon is so cheaply put together it was falling to pieces the bed was very hard similar to sleeping on a dining table we could hear the rooftop air conditioner on level from the th floor there isnt any soundproofing so you can hear everyone in the hallway the breakfast buffet was awful the floor was very wet and sticky the food wasnt edible and there is a sign that states there is a gms surcharge if you leave food on your plate very hard to avoid when the food is awful we were booked for nights and only lasted we moved somewhere else
1643,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,very accessible to major places we loved our stay here ryan vee helped us for check in and was quite jovial and helpful the hotel is very close to mrt and bus station even at the night the hotel was flocked with visitors the people assosciated with luggage parking and housekeeping were very helpful appreciate the hospitality loved the view from the room
1644,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,kind good service good price good laundry my best experience with the hotel boss has been with staff overall especially alex huang from reception who helped me kindly general staff at the lobby were very supportive and patient in giving directions great hotelgreat customer service very clean room
1645,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,great location amazing staff the hotel is very neat my best experience with the hotel has been with staff overall they are all amazing especially alex from reception who helped me kindly with my request the only problem about the hotell is the size of their rooms they are too small and there hardly any storage space other than that a great establishment with great people working there
1646,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,the worst no words can say how bad this hotel is the staff do not speak english so all communication is hard the room is so small and nowhere to put your clothes so you have to live out your suitcase the hotel is beautiful and pool great but everything else is so bad we booked the room with a balcony and asked for wine glasses as there was no glasses in the room after phone calls and been sent mugs to the room i requested to speak to a manger and he said we dont do glasses end of total rude i told him for a night i at least expect glasses in the room no response absolutely disgusting dont waste your money booking here
1647,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,excellent hotel great hotelgreat customer service very clean room eric at the front desk was very patient calm and supportive liu fei cleaned my room professionally with precision and a speed that baffled me she was respectful and full of smiles as she does her job general staff at the lobby were very supportive and patient in giving directions
1648,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,superb location and modern location is fantastic mins walking distance to lavender mrt and sheltered all the way rooms are pretty small but modern however one downside is the tv no channel on it i try to use the youtube but as the wifi was so bad it couldnt play at all kinda wasted having a tv in the room as nothing can be play on it
1649,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,dorminatry and nothing else shocker just a shocker for the amount of money they charge i missed the first warning sign laundry photo why would a good hotel do that second one was when we have been asked to pay upfront at the actual hotel at reception so you would not even bother to check out and look for a better hotel the third one watch for the hanger on the pictures rooms are so small that there is no space for wardrobes put requests no one even bothered to get back bathroom is so small that there is no toilet paper no toilet paper tissues about your head and you can forget to seat there normally there is no space to put your leg shower glass is next to the toilet if the room is not facing city your window is meters from another glass wall like in prison and in reflection you are not just seeing yourself but all your neighbours and what they do in addition of others not closing their blinds on opposite side my son is still laughing about this advertisement on their tv midtier hotel and says that the room is smaller than his year school camp cabin we are still here and will try to enjoy the singapore
1650,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,accessible what i like about it is that it is near the mrt station and other mode of transportation is not that hard it is very accessible and there are many places you can go sultan mosque is just mins walk while mustafa centre is mins we always walks around pm and we comes back at am and you can feel that you are safe the staff are nice we got rooms cause we are pax its just a shame that the family room is not on the same floor as the rooms because they said that there is only one family room per floor what i dont like is that they only clean the rooms once a week but im not reaaly that sure if it is once a week only because we stayed there for nights and days we thought that everyday they will clean the rooms we got rooms cause we are pax
1651,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,execellent location very attentive and helpful staff i love the location of the hotel as it is only a walking distance to the shopping center bugis junction etc and restaurants arab streets little india and newton hawkers place is also nearby public transit is just in front the hotel and a mins walk to the mrt station the hotel room is clean and tidy although it is a bit smaller than what we expect the good thing our room has balcony which is fantastic the hotel also provides common area for launderette and ironing in the th floor of the hotel
1652,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,misrepresentation the room was not a superior double room it was even small for a standard double room the bathroom was tiny shower head kept falling off every time you adjusted water pressure one little rail to hang your clothes so little floor space very difficult to know where to put luggage only one at a time can walk at end of bed no glasses asked but told not allowed safe worked well breakfast cold scrambled eggs cold tea and coffee website depicts a very different scenario we flew from thailand where we spent weeks hotel boss was the worst place we stayed on our trip another thing no sound insulation heard all other guests
1653,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,wifi does not work period if you want to stay in singapore with no internet then book this place dozens of guests screaming at the front desk to be able to reply emails and watch netflix we are paying usd a day to not have wifi in the most developed city in asia in the st century really
1654,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,singapore hotel we booked hotel as it had a balcony fresh air access pros central location near little india chinatown shopping marina bay independant restaurantsbars on site to choose from generous balcony polite reception crew pool area nice clean bus stop out the front money changer out front convenience shop out front no mini bar in room cons wasnt told housekeeping every nd day oddsevens no rubbish removal we had to put bags in corridor at end of the day hoping someone would pickup they did the excuse was going green cutting costs i would say had to ask for water coffee sachets daily albeit very apologetic housekeeping crews cm of hanging space above the kettle cm between bed walls so difficult to move around luggage toilet tissue
1655,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,soundproofing negative hotel boss sounded like a good deal at first stars are over rated rooms are tiny sound proofing what is that showers and toilet flushing disturb your sleep in the middle of the night the liftbell the banging of the lift counter weights will not help your sleep either finally every word spoken on the corridor will make it to your room can only recommend it when you go out for some drinks and return completely hammered
1656,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,good hotel it was a wonderful experience staying in this hotel the room attendant was very attentive requests were provided immediately i felt at home during my stay in hotel boss food was okay looking forward to stay again when i meet my friends again in singapore
1657,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,the best ever resort ritz carlton resort spa langkawi one of luxury resort in the langkawi tropical rain forest with stunting view there is lot of wild animal in the resort monkey dusky monkey with long tail flying squirrel and hornbill very comfortable relaxing stay and staff very friendly and helpful at this resort highly recommend those whom looking to relax body mind and soul and pamper your self
1658,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,most probably overpriced this property was almost a nightmare they had small rooms with no space for extra luggage space was only enough for person to walk around no wardrobe provided but instead they built some sort of clothes rail above the desk next to the mounted tv tea and coffee were provided but it wasnt the branded ones like nescafelipton what shocked me was they only schedule room cleaning every other day this means you will see trash bins along the corridors the only plus side to this hotel is the halal breakfast and also its location which is near to mrt haji lanearab street and mustafa centre
1659,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,nice hotel staff need to be train the hotel is bigbut the room is small the staff is unfriendly one day the room bathroom has a smell when we feedback they did not do anything the swimming pool is bigits hard to find indian food in the hotel
1660,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,singapore vacay we stayed days at hotel boss with my sister and her son very nice accomodating clean hotel planning to go back again thanks so much uncle faizal very friendly hotel bell mansee you soon more power
1661,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,eecky rooms dirty rooms lipstick stains on cups beds are not cleaned nor floors are never vaccumed shower drains are clogged with hair they only clean your room every other day they dont refill your room essentials like tissue or soap unless you ask for it the place is jampacked with tour buses so expect alot of crowd hairballs were found under the bed
1662,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,worst hotel dont even visit for free rude staff no food options for veg no cleanliness on the name of go green they dont even clean the room daily small cabin type of rooms must avoid they are very arrogant just because they get much bookings due to so much tourism in singapore but if we start avoiding they will come to know the power of tourists special avoid for veg people worst property
1663,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,bad experience extremely small rooms zero hospitality giving stars for the location near to little india breakfast was again as bad as possible rude staff at restaurant at they were actually removing the food in a very bad way will never come back to this property
1664,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,clean and quiet stayed here while in singapore great access to underground rail good local food and shops plenty of eating options nearby and like most places in singapore walking to a favorite place is not an issue at all
1665,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,not quite the boss we chose hotel boss after visiting its website and reading the reviews here on trip advisor it is a short walk away from mrt lavender and little india we booked a family room for three we arrived at lunchtime and was pleasantly delighted we could check in and use our room immediately after such a long flight this was most welcome our room was on the th floor we had a beautiful view of the city however the room was small and not furnished like their website photos so be prepared the room consisted of a double and single bed the room has a safe hairdryer and tea coffee making facilities the bathroom is compact and the shower was powerful enough the room was serviced every second day but extra towels can be found beside the pool the pool can be found on the th
1666,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,overpriced hotel check in they allowed us early check in we arrived before lunch and the check in process was fairly quick this should have been plus points but when we got to our rooms we found out why such a big hotel can do early check ins despite the busy in out of gueststhe room is absolutely dirty cleanliness this has been the dirtiest hotel we have checked in abroad when we moved the side table around there was a big tuft of hairball underneath the table it was dusty underneath the bed there was even a piece of trash left under the bed when i called the front desk to complain they only cleaned it the day after because the housekeepings schedule is every other day the windowsill was dusty the shelf above the exposed cabinet was also dusty to think that these
1667,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,nice hotel my husband and i stayed at hotel boss for three nights the check in process was very quick and staff were friendly and helpful the rooms were very clean and they give you a towel and some shower amendments such as body wash and shampoo if you want your towels changing you need to inform reception the room was very small the pool area was clean and had a nice view of the city the gym was small and busy so was hard to get onto the machines the hotel is around minutes walk from haji lane which is a nice area to drink and eat the hotel will order you a taxi if needed a taxi from the hotel is about singapore dollars the underground is a short minute walk and very easy to use we would recommend you using this to get to the main attractions like gardens by the bay
1668,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,i cant stay in such hotels havent seen ever in my life such small rooms without wardrobes you just cant move in room yet priced very high in bathroom the same situation one just cant move no amenities free tea given the in pouches is of very poor quality and taste hopeless
1669,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel boss excellent service the staff are very good and helpful ms ivy helped for smooth checkin of room and in everything you need there very nice and clean rooms but the superiors room are very small not as big as seen in the images
1670,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,the hotel charges you a hefty amount with minimal services we stayed there for days size of the room is so small that you will have to think twice about where to unpack your bags no cupboards no press no sleepers and mind it it is q star hotel on the first day when we came back to the room in the evening the room was not cleaned at all even the bed and the bathroom was not cleaned on asking they told that we clean it every alternate day when asked to get the clean cups for the room the manager told us to wash the cups in the room and use it again never had such ugly experience in a star hotel i will request people never to book this hotel if you are staying for days and are expecting a clean room during your stay pathetic experience the hotel should go through a services audit
1671,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,great location room was quite small but clean and well equipped overall great stay staff was extremely nice and helpful singapore is an expensive destination compared to a lot of other countries and people should have realistic expectations a decent hotel in singapore in a great location with good or decent service and expect to pay cents the cleaning service happens every other day for sustainability reasons wifi works just fine
1672,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,dont expect too much on this stars hotel pros check in procedure quite fast mins walking distance from lavender mrt cons small room and bathroom wifi super slow room not sound proof heard people walking and talking early in the morning ac noisy make up room once every days only need call reception for daily amenities no mini bar not worth the money per night for such room
1673,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,not meeting expectations and do not recommend pros location cons breakfast did not have almost any options for continental breakfast at first we were even inserted in a halal breakfast we only had cereal to eat we talked with the reception and we were moved to a supposedly more continental breakfast which had almost the same options all the provided food was for asian breakfast considering this is a star hotel we were expecting more as we were paying dollars per breakfast per person the room was small and we could hear everything happening in the next room and hallways our room was only cleaned once in three days which is not acceptable in a star hotel the amenities of the room were only replaced for one person
1674,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,singapore tours poor hotel i will term it as sarai no room service rooms cleaned after alternate days lots of rush ton s of people like a hostel when you call front desk they say shortage of staff rooms are too small bathroom are too small just like a public bathroom although public bathrooms are much better no jet in toilets one thing good close to indian restaurants that is why deserves one star some booking sites are predicting star but i will rate it as sarai better to spent some more money and opt for better hotel after placing beds in room not a inch place left for moving worst ever hotel i have visited on abroad from indiaroom size bathroom so dont ever visit this public charitable sarai and spent little bit bit of money for good hotel so again no room
1675,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,decent hotel in good location with suggested minor improvements decent hotel in a good location just mins walk straight to the lavender mrt however they could improve a bit on housekeeping stayed for nights but got serviced for changing bedsheets and towel on nd night which was fine though found one of the replaced towels stained and the maid did not even bother replacing a used coffee cup that was left on the table surprised that room was a bit smaller than expected as seen in the photos but it was fine for just one person there is a money exchange and nice restaurant right next to the hotel a mall just next to the mrt so quite convenient in terms of food so breakfast at the hotel is unnecesary
1676,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,best manager at hotel boss i was frustrated with hotel staffs and the noise when i first checked in keith manager who works in the evening is beyond wonderful i found other managers who work in the morning are some what not that nice to the guests i asked for same assistance in terms of room complaint or noise complaint and they werent that helpful keith is the only one who took his time and showed me other rooms for me to choose due to noise issues with other guests thanks to keith im able to sleep so peacefully keith also helped me with updating singtel sim card so kindly i couldnt appreciate him more i would definitely come back to this hotel because of keith thank you keith for making my stay so much better
1677,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,great location but poor facilities great location but poor facilities i checked into this hotel with my partner and when i was taken to the room i said that there was a mistake because id booked a premier room the porter said to me that all rooms were the same the room is totally about m x m and the bed is tiny there is one drawer and no robe the only coffee is three in one the toilet paper is the cheap sheet dispenser and the sink has been blocked since we arrived when we checked in we were told that the room would only be serviced every second day would be good to disclose that on the website seeing as a daily clean is standard in hotels the failure to clean the room also included the daily water provided that is no water provided when the room wasnt serviced the gym is just an
1678,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,strategic location with park surrounding nice we love it so much to stay there hotel is near lavender mrt station surrounding by garden and tree so you guys who love morning walk or running it is verry recommended we had stay at triple room with quite small room but enough for us just to take a sleep at night we can go to nearest mrt lavender station by walk about mins bus stop just accross the street thank you for the experience for this couple days
1679,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,disappointing stayed on a city break for my birthday staff was lovely on checkin room was very small with no space to keep luggage open there were some minor cleaning issues hair on a wall coffee stain on window sill the pillows were a little on the hard side and when my partner went down to ask for a softer one they brought one without a pillow case the shower water pressure was sooooooo low as was the height of the shower head however it was a good location easy to cycle or catch a cab into the city centre
1680,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,worst service and boss hotel service zero im really sorry i will never recommend anyone for this property when we requested for extended hours front desk lady informed have to pay extra and we paid after paying again keep calling and asking for extra money but we checked in arrivals day hrs we requested for checked out hrs till asked to pay around keep calling and ask to pay extra amenities have to call always reception room cleaning we have to call and beg reception for cleaning the day we arrived my fiancé perfume bottle felt down and whole glasses were floor and begged reception to clean for days later on i took picture and showed to reception front office or operator has to get more tranning room is not soundproof and its very noisy customer

1682,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,hotel boss we had stayed at the hotel for nights and booked two rooms for of us rooms were really compacted and not really had space to live around on their site it was showing a different rooms than what we got breakfasts buffet was okay overly crowded due to the high demand staffs were friendly and helpful specially the bell boys hotels location is outstanding mins walk from lavender mrt and right opposite blk bus station which connects to almost every other place in singapore downtown walking distance to mustafa center and little india

1685,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,this time not a good one very bad experience the receptionist was not friendly at all and not flexible with the request the room was not up to standard as well this is my second stay the first stay was amazing no protocol for safety and hygiene this time would not recommend
1686,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,huge budget hotel this is very big hotel too many rooms but rooms are congested very noisy sound in reception may be there was a large group although there are huge people in the reception service are nice complimentary tea coffee in the room with hot water cattle there was hair drier also in singapore the price of hotel is high

1688,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,wedding anniversary boring staycation book the hotel thru their website last may to celebrate our wedding anniversary i will list the pros and cons pros booking request was granted high floors and late checkout room is neat and clean bed is just nice not too soft and not too hard very near to bus stop and cbd area staff at the reception was cordial cons room too small for a couple entertainment is zero tv only free local channel wifi snail pace the tv have option to watch youtube but the lag freezing the screen the room price is too much for for such small room and toilet the room sound proofing is too bad that you can hear adjacent rooms conversation no cabinet or closet i brought a wine and when i ask to borrow wine opener they said i have to bring it down for them to
1689,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,great hospitality and excellent location booked a stayca over the weekends th apr for a superior twin room was given a high floor th floor with an awesome city view even though the room was small but it was really clean and just nice for pax staffs were also helpful with our enquiry friendly and served with a smile the hotel is also surrounded by great food overall awesome experience and will come back again if i have the chance
1690,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,great views we had early check in at about am and late check out at pm was grantedi requested for a high floor and it was also granted the room was rather small at sq m thankfully the view made up for the small space we could see the sports hub the singapore flyer and village hotel at bugis amenities was basic with toothbrushes shower gel and conditioning shampoo i didnt like the dispenser with sheets of paper i stead of a toilet roll thankfully i was prepared and brought my own toilet roll there is a writing table a chair and a beside table bottled water was provided and the mini fridge was cold enough to store your own stuff no bathroom slippers were provided and we werent sure if the floor was clean enough to sit on so we sat on the bed most of the time there
1691,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,simple use of sgdiscover vouchers checkin was quite fast and simple rooms were on a nice high floor and had quite a good view the rooms were quite clean the mattress was very comfortable but the pillows were much too soft bottled water is already provided in the room only thing missing would probably be a pair of disposable bed slippers the room could afford to be abit more noiseproof could hear people walking and talking in the corridors easily breakfast needs to seriously be improved though the serers were very welcoming and polite with warm smiles however the western and asian breakfasts should be served hot it was barely lukewarm especially when your serving food like scrambled eggs and bacon ham and sausage and pancakes all these should be hot its a good thing customers could still toast
1692,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,super great experience my roommate left his passport in the cab and the hotel did their best to help us wiz finding the cab wiz only one receive mr faizal tan has done a very excellent job finally wiz a few hours the passport is back
1693,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,very average the pros are location and view from balcony is wonderful were on a high floor strong breeze and nice city skyline plenty of options around for food both hawker and restaurants the auntie in charge of room sanitation is friendly helpful and quick when we asked for fresh pillow cases the cons are hairdryer doesnt work dated decor and furnishings poor soundproofing secondhand smoke from neighbours on the balcony its a non smoking hotel but people flout the rules which isnt the hotels fault but dampens the experience i can hear my neighbours quarrelling at night and loud traffic below the mattress is not the most comfortable ordinary facilities the central ac is in need of a deep cleanse
1694,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,front desk mr kar heng i was at a and star hotels before heading to hotel boss with my family out of the hotels mr kar heng left me the deepest impression in terms of service excellence professional and is sincere when attending to guests there were others in suits which i assume hold a higher appointment than him but they should go to kar heng to learn a thing about service room size is small and you get what you paid for but cleanliness shouldnt be taken lightly hairs on the bed and toilet sink found upon check in instead of only being the biggest mid tier hotel try being the best mid tier hotel instead
1695,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,staycation big hotel with many small rooms kind of like sewage smell in the premises and in our room poor sound proof as im a light sleeper could hear somebody talking in the middle of am we stayed the inward facing family room with balcony only view is another room just opposite noise with echo can project from this inward area which i could also hear in the middle of night with a group of people talking and laughing is more light a chalet rather a hotel from picture room floor looks light laminated wood flooring but is actually tiles with woody design our family have another premier balcony room which is better at least is city view with big balcony felt complex if you drive to the carpark you will see lots of motor cycle at level some even ride recklessly however the
1696,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,average hotel staycation for days nights in superior balcony room was small but fine for me very basic room amenities cleanliness is so so ants on dressing table so cant put food there toilet has a kind of smell and no bidet no toilet paper rolls just small tissues the balcony has no privacy as mine was facing to other rooms and no views i like that theres smart tv in the room with you tube app as therewas just local channels to watch wifi was good checked in was pretty fast and no hassle the pool area were nice with sitting area to enjoy the windy breeze overall it was ok location wise is centralized good
1697,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good price with pool gym and restaurants including halal ones stayed with family in two rooms which were quite frankly tiny but functional small fridge big windows area to hang clothes and accommodate small luggages desk and some drawers one side table with storage space underneath etc bathrooms were small too but it has adequate space for shower cabin shelf for toiletries sink with adequate space for other toiletries and makeup stuff very important for ladies ironing facilities are provided in a separate place the only reason why im deducting one star is the room size if you come with large luggages as people normally do when travelling asia you might want to consider a much bigger than their standard room which will cost more i imagine even then it feels rather stuffy because of the very little space in which to
1698,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,singapore visit the location was nice and the food was amazing but the rooms were very small the staff was was very nice and adjustable i would recommend that people should visit the hotel the ambiance was good and the major attraction was the swimming pool

1700,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,modern hotel in a great location with great service hotel boss is about the location there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and lavender mrt station is m away bugis and city hall area is a short bus ride away and kampong glam is within walking distance checkin was surprisingly quick given the long queues inside the lobby as well as separate long queues outside the hotel one along its dropoff point via syed alwi road and another along its front victoria street the staff were friendly and welcoming pretty good attitude given the large crowd and checkins its a midrange hotel with many rooms the rooms however are pretty small tiny i would say i have got a triple room and the distance between the foot of the bed and the desk is about a persons width the ensuite toilet is tiny too a bigsized

1709,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,weekday staycation in hotel boss pleasantly greeted over at the counter and was given room on the upper level beautiful view especially from the balcony mini ants is unavoidable coming off from the balcony and was on the tabletop the manager justin was helpful and efficient wasted no time to assist when theres issue with the room door will recommend this place to my family and friends for sure adequate place for a short staycation
1710,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,a thorough review on my day nights at hotel boss room with balcony today is my last day of my staycation at hotel boss and i think i shall give my thoughts on this hotel i booked the room with the balcony and my room is on the floor the view out of the balcony is pretty mediocre but in my opinion fyi the balcony have no privacy at all so please do not be in your birthday suit jokes aside when i entered into the room the first time i was surprised that it was soooo small when i say small i meant really small but it isnt much of a problem the cleanliness of the room id say is the bed is decent size and comes with pillow total one for me and one for my gf on the second day we decided to ask for more pillow and when we ask the counter for pillow i was greeted with a kind gentleman that promptly asked me for my room number

1715,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,centrally located wonderful stay after quite a bit of search and through scanning of the hotels in singapore we freezed on this as it was our first trip location wise i would say one of the best centrally located close to bugis and lavender mrt stations and close proximity to orchard road city hall and bugis buses available a step away the famous arab street is just a short walk away the lobby of the room was really nice but the rooms were really small checkin was a breeze but the front office could be a little more courteous many restaurants and food options in the vicinity and we decided not to opt for inhouse breakfast and thought to explore the many eateries in the surrounding overall we stayed for nights and i would recommend this place to fellow travelers
1716,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,staycation pleasant experience but swimming pool system needs improvement my family went on a one night staycation on dec the lobby was nice but the room was really small but still clean in general except for a few ants crawling around on the table we were served by fiona and lionel at the lobby upon registration they were very friendly and helpful they made us felt warmly welcomed and answered all our enquiries regarding our stay i was pleased with the accommodation and food however i was very upset and disappointed by the swimming pool queueing system we had staycations at other hotels before and the swimming pool slots were assigned and we just had to come down to the pool during our assigned timeslot for hotel boss we had to rush down to queue in our swimming wear as it was based on first come first serve system my husband brought
1717,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,location is conveniently located to good places to eat shopping check in check out is a breeze stayed for nights days room is really small but if youre staying alone its acceptable room has a smell not quite sure what it is maybe a cigarette smell but unlikely as hotel is a non smoking place i was looking forward to a cable channel but was disappointed when i was told that at this time no cable channels when i was really looking forward to watch all cable channels available internet connection is rubbish i had to call twice rd time i was able to fix it myself for someone to fix it as i cannot watch tv otherwise local channels as youtube is directly connected on tv room service isnt that good too i need to do a follow up call a few time as time had passed already and i still dont received my request and another
1718,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,rooms longchairs rooms and longchairs at the pool you do the mathscome to queue every hour told me the staff like if i wanted to spend my holiday queueing covid is the excuse the hotel uses to justify one of many lies queueing at the pool no booking possible our family room looks like a dark closet the noise on the balcony gives the feeling to be on a highway nice job done on internet to make up the reality cant wait the breakfast it should surely be an interesting experience
1719,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,staycation managed to check in early as per informed by reservation location is good bad experience when check in was served by chris at the reception attitude is super lousy impolite never inform about the lunch or dinner included as mention when reservation made also never mention about late check out which was mention in the reservation email by hotel boss only upon asked his reply is have lah have lor other hotel staff are more polite especially those at lobby area room is small and price is average lunch set also cannot make it chicken chop n fish fillet is cut into half of actual size room have smoking smell especially in toilet

1734,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,a comforting and peaceful nights retreat ive stayed at hotel boss several times before and so far i have enjoyed my stays this time around ive decided once more to try a nights retreat to recharge and relax away from my rented place this hotel is also memorable for me since it is one of my go to hotels to book whenever i have loved ones visiting firstly the price is right on the spot for a star hotel which is not too expensive i booked their promo for nights which costs me only sgd including tax secondly i personally loved their lobby with the big grand chandelier but i missed the gloria jeans coffee right inside it their restaurant at the lobby is also closed checkin is quite fast as there is no line and my room is quite spacious it has a comfortable queen size bed complimentary
1735,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,clean near to train station but horrendous guest eperience no doubt that the location of the hotel is accessible m away from the train station and buses available a step away from the hotel entrance it is easy to get food and there is tons of optionsto get food delivery around the area room is pretty small but suffice for a night rest away from hotel and work destress however checking in was horrendous i am appalled by the service that were given by the concierge service zero empathy this is how the checking in was like front desk what can i help you with me hi good afternoon to you i will like to check in please fd do you make booking me yes this is my booking itinerary and heres my identification me if its possible can i request for a room with balcony if available fd yes extra me
1736,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,disappointed booked with hotel boss for a staycation in the month of october via agoda we were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking nor informed upon checking in the purpose of opening up staycation package post covid clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities else are we suppose to just rot in the room have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area closing the facilities due to covid measures shouldnt be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users avoiding essential information on the booking page is a form of misrepresentation good luck to you
1737,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,very good customer service and perfect accomodation i enjoyed my staycation here the hotel is exceptionally clean and the location is perfect as there are nearby eateries i would like to compliment the front staff at the counter by the name of ivy as she had made my stay here a good one we requested for an upgrade of room and she went the extra mile to try to accommodate to our needs and request she was also very polite and cheerful i would like the management to recognise her good service overall out of for the hotel
1738,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,feedback great location clean and nice hotel however the female staff that attended to me was extremely rude and unpleasant when i was seeking clarification she did not even bother telling me that the hotel pool and gym were closed and again at check out the same staff rude and impolite hope the management can do something about this

1755,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,small rooms but surprisingly efficient what is it with hotels in singapore having extremely cramped rooms my room was a standard twin bed there was no space to move after placing two large bags of my friend and mine the room had a window which was as good as nothing anyways my review will not be based on the rooms size as its a common trend in most of the hotels in singapore these kind of hotels are good to come back to only sleep after having spent most of the day exploring the city room apart from the description above the room had paper thin walls you would be comfortable to use the bathroom only if you know your roommate well the bathroom was surprisingly spacious enough to do your morning duties and have a shower too i chose this hotel over others as the shower area was separated by a glass

1781,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,leisure the room we previously had was very small and crampy the officer who attended to us suggested the family room and he upgraded us with a good price the family room though it was a little larger than the previous one bt it fits all of us nicely
1782,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,nice hotel and staff friendly staff and nice hotel clean comfortable and care near to go anywhere near to mosque restaurants mustafa bus stations mrt nice view a staff name leslie and friends such a good and friendly to ustqvm
1783,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,bad service and tiny room the service was very bad and unprofessional we requested for water to be sent to our room and we waited for almost mins and had to call twice they were not apologetic at all later the night we requested for fork and spoons as we wanted to eat in our room but to my horror they said they were out of spoons what kind of star hotel doesnt have enough spoons they eventually provided us with two wooden chopsticks and two plastic forks what a disappointment and to add on when we checked in the room floor was dusty and didnt seem to be cleaned properly did not feel comfortable staying here at hotel boss
1784,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,good services hasslefree with fiona liu efficient and professional thank you so much thank you for also making my th birthday memorable with the good services and booking issues i accidentally made a wrong date book but with her help everything went by smoothly
1785,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,budget friendly its a budget friendly hotel located very nearby to little india food market the services are amazing the breakfast overall was amazing but as a pure vegetarian i just had a option of breadtea and coffee so a drawback for food options book without breakfast and u can go to nearby indian chain of restaurants overall a pleasant stay there is bus stands and metro station nearby which is a plus point below pics are the view from my room
1786,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,very efficient this is a very clean and practical hotel in an ideal location i got a taxi from the taxi and was shocked by a how cheap it was but b how well organised everything was when i arrived at hotel boss tan lin chong showed me to my room and was very kind and helpful thanks
1787,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,clean comfy costfriendly my daughter and i recently spent days and nights in singapore hotel boss gave us a clean compact twin bed room with all the facilities one expects of a good business hotel and at a very reasonable cost its location is perfect for quick access to the metro or bus services and it is within walking distance of many places on the firsttime visitors list like kampung gelam and little india besides that it is quite close to the airport so the cab transit is cheap if you choose and i recommend this not to eat breakfast at the hotel there are dozens of options to fit every appetite and budget just outside and a few steps away the reception and housekeeping staff were friendly helpful and efficient if i had the opportunity to visit this wonderful island again i
1788,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,stay in hotel boss i was stay in this hotel for more than one day and i found all hotel staf found very good and very cooperative all the time rachel communicate closely and provides all necessary information to me room codition and cleanliness fond good and toilets also found in very good condition and i am taking this opportunity to advice others to take this hotel during your stay in singapore
1789,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel review hotel bossis good for me when i stay in day the roome is cleand also the toilet im feel comfotable hotel boss is very good staff also very good and frendly to thier costumer especially miss fiona liu will xome back again
1790,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,pleasant staff and clean room i found myself unexpectedly stuck in transit and my work put me in this hotel the room was clean and comfortable but fairly basic i found that the water temperature in the shower at night was less hot than it was in the morning for some reason what made the stay pleasant was that all the staff were consistently very friendly polite and accommodating also the hotel is in a pretty good location and within walking distance of arab street and some good local eateries would stay there again
1791,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good stay stayed at family room for one night to celebrate birthday hotel didnt provide any cake despite was informed room was clean with balcony room size was quite small but acceptable for short term stay basic amenities were provided however there was no hot water at night and only hot water in morning they need to check their heater system staff at check in counter and level restaurant were very friendly
1792,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,first stay when i checked in on the th the particular gsobella who served me wasnt really friendly and definitely gave me the unwelcoming vibes however my friends and i was greeted by another gsonurul on the second night of our stay with pleasant hospitality vibes and definitely makes our experience a whole lot better overall the hotel is a very nice establishment for fun time with friends and loved ones will definitely come back there soon
1793,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,helpful and accommodating staff ive stayed in hotel boss on th march for night i was given a room that was definitely not my preference but thanks to nurul of the staff working on that day with her help and effort i managed to change to a better room with good view thank u nurul i really appreciate the extra mile good job and keep it up
1794,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,first time in hotel boss hotel boss its very clean hotel and good accommodation and rooms all the crew its so friendly perfect hotel fiona liu friendly and helpful to guide me for the places that i need to go thank you
1795,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,amazing room and location nice staff gym a bit lacking its near lots of halal good food and massage areas staff also allowed us a late checkout for free we used the gym once it was nice but a bit small and the ventilation wasnt good there so it got a little stuffy but maybe it was because we visited the gym after the operating hours it was still open for guests use though we didnt hack it or anything the room was really nice and clean super comfortable stay will definitely come here again
1796,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,convenient and affordable this hotel was a great stop off for a couple of days sightseeing its a large hotel thats known by all taxi drivers and is in close proximity to all transport links and less than mins to the airport lots of eateries in the locality its a mid range standard with an affordable price range significantly lower than many large hotels in singapore the amenities in the room are a little basic and the rooms are exceptionally small however given the cost of real estate and the price of other accommodation this was a minor inconvenience this is a great choice for reliable accommodation in an accessible location
1797,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,friendly staff i just spent three days in this hotel it has everything you need the room is clean and is equipped with darkened shadesit is close to the lavender mrt i was able to reach the central area in minutes i look forward to my next stay at the end of the month
1798,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,decent hotel in singapore very quick check in and check out the room is reasonably clean simple practice easy to reach from changi airport also very easy to find food around the hotel the staff is helpful the price is a bit more compare to what we expect to received but in singapore everything is not cheap recommended to stay when you have short business trip to singapore
1799,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good business inn must admit it serves the best for the price paid in city center gym and pool is decent lobby is spacious for reception of checkin at a go the only shortfall will be the room configuration will be more market concentric for tourists instead of business traveler
1800,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,great services great services friendly staff delirious food fully furnished hotel pet allowed in this hotel fully ac hotel great out seeing and seprated smoking area fress wif i services in hoels swimming pool is good

1805,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good location stayed here for nights in november we had a balcony room and were glad we paid a little extra as we saw the standard rooms and they were tiny ours wasnt that much bigger but not so chlastaphobic as we had the large balcony to use too breakfast was mainly indian food not quite what i fancy for breakfast so we made do with scrambled egg sausage and toast and jam good location close to a corner shop for goodies for the room and close to metro too to get anywhere within the city we did the hop on hop off bus tour where we explored most of the sights of the city so definately a good idea if you want to see everything probably cheaper booking online too although hotel price was only about difference overall good hotel at a reasonable rate
1806,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,excellent service we would like to highly recommend hotel boss for giving us star serice the service was excellent and beyond aside from the service given by fiona liu and the rest of the reception the location was just superb and its closed by the train station the service just made our trip memorable thank you again to the rest of the crew for making it possible fiona liu thank you

1827,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,superior room stay great hospitality and maintained proper hygiene and was very quick in servicing just room problem with superior room too small so if you have to stay take premium balcony room with bigger size rachel from the staff was helpful with us in our stay
1828,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,more like a hostel the room was the smallest i have had anywhere there was barely enough room to walk around the bed no drawers and not enough room to even unpack a case the only hanging space was a few coat hangers on a rail above the television it had a nice outside area with a swimming pool but very few beds and even fewer chairs the only sitting area is in the lobby which got very congested with people looking after their luggage this hotel was so basic i moved to another hotel
1829,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,nd wedding anniversary trip hotel ambiance and staff is very cooperative msfiona lin asst guest service manager is a wonderful lady she helped me to make our stay comfortable at the hotel bossshe got me to garden by the bay by bus
1830,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,centrally located with great rooms the hotel is centrally located very near to the metro and local bus stop the rooms are tiny thats the only drawback food is nice and staffs are experienced and friendly the outdoor swimming pool and a basic gym is definitely an add on overall a great experience
1831,Hotel Boss Singapore9,2,budget hotel in singapore classic case of you get what you pay for we stayed here for three nights while travelling through asia and this was by far the most expensive hotel purely because of the location however worth spending a bit more money and staying elsewhere pros location not too bad min walk to nearest metro station has a gym although very limited large swimming pool cons no offer to help carrying our heavy bags up to the room seemed to be self service form the start first room was near the lifts and extremely noisy despite specifically requesting a quiet room no excuse for this plenty of empty rooms in a hotel if this size especially given current affairs basic customer service safety deposit box did not work in the first room duvet cover torn moved to a second
1832,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good value for money great location and service nice city view we stayed at the triple room on the th floor and had a great view of the city skyline the room was modern spotless and the beds were comfy however it was too small but i guess it was mostly the case in singapore the location was great theres a bus stop right outside and the metro was walking distance its also close to the famous arab street and haji lane so theres lots of food options until late service was also commendable esp since they let us check in early and allowed us to keep our luggage after check out thanks for making our stay in singapore a comfortable and memorable one
1833,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,nice place nice location this hotel is convenient to go around because its location is very near lavender mrt station it is easy to look for some foods at below hotel and around the lavender station even hotel room is small as usual hotel room in singapore but the room is nice clean ans cozy
1834,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,very disappointing dont judge a book by its cover not a cheap hotel looks flash and modern but you will find when you get in reality will surprise you a super small room only sized for person our shower door did not close so leaked water on floor no hand towels only bath towels and floor mat the room had a weird smell one pillow each one side table not enough room for more than one suitcase the room is modern in style but lacks lighting breakfast was basic to say the least and more for non european customers would we stay again or would we recommend boss to friendsno we wouldnt very disappointing as its location has advantages
1835,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,perfect for a long layover first i want to thank hotel boss for the early check in without an additional charge fatima was friendly and professional and booked me a city view room i knew the room would be small so i wasnt disappointed easy to get to from changi on the mrt and only a five minutes walk from lavender station apparently they do have an airport shuttle service for a nominal fee if i have another long layover in singapore i will go to the boss
1836,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,visit to singapore wonderful in all aspects stayed here for days the hotel has a very beautiful lobby the view from the window is nice rooms are bit small but nice and cozy serves fresh food miss rachel here helped me too about my next trip people here are very cooperative and friendly definitely gonna come back
1837,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel boss we had a great time in hotel boss the staff are very accommodating and friendly we really like the location of the hotel it is near haji lane and bugis walking distance we will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family thank you hotel boss
1838,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel rooms the best place to come and stay in this hotel also morning breakfast is besthotel staff and persons also very helpinghotel entrance is very nicethere is space for your lugage and rachel help for inquiry and we are coming back soon
1839,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good hotel in a fantastic location budget mid range this high end budget hotel is busy hotel in great location also right near lavender mrt rooms were compact and spotlessly clean and the staff were very attentive and very knowledgeable of singapore the rooms had an amazing view of singapore the only reason i did not give this top marks is the breakfast and breakfast area is not up to the high singapore standards i think when i stayed it was exceptionally busy so i will give the hotel the benefit of the doubt on this occasion saying this i would stay here again as it is extremely good value for money all round
1840,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel boss singapore i came to know about this hotel from one of my friend every thing about this hotel is good except on the size of the rooms if we are considering as per indian standard for star and above however i believe the average size of rooms in singapore is smaller when compared to india location wise this hotel is located at center place to various places such as little india lavender mrt and other market the hotel staff is very prompt and does make sure that guest are treated nicely hotel rooms are clean and if you include indian breakfast then it is average dont expect similar buffet which hotels in india offers to you but it is sufficient so do go for it
1841,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,leisure it was really nice to stay here at hotel boss as the people are very friendly and the room was very nice and clean housekeeping service was very nice as well we will surely comeback here next time ms fiona liu was very helpful when in comes to the most tourist spots
1842,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,family from california my first time in singapore was great because of hotel boss i recommend staying here because its cleal and the service is outstanding the check in was easy and its very reasonable racheal assistanced me by helping me have a good stay
1843,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,my room was smaller than the elevator great location but i told reception that my wife had a mobility scooter and asked if my allocated room was big enough to accommodate it i was assured that it was it wasnt i had to open the room door leading to the hotel corridor reverse the scooter out before i could use the bathroom the breakfast was the worst i have ever had in any hotel in the world the food was cold the coffee machine didnt work the staff were surly to the point of rudeness
1844,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,convenient value for money the hotel is very big and very nice with helpful staffs clean rooms some of the facilities are swimming pool gymn playing ground for kids the location of the hotel is very strategic about minutes walking distance from lavender mrt a bus stop right in front of the hotel there are restaurants foodcourt mini mart and a small park nearby overall my family i really enjoy staying in hotel boss
1845,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,good place but tiny rooms hotel boss is near the lavender mrt it is a fairly big place with a large number of rooms like every other place in singapore the service is professional the rooms are quite tiny even by singapore standards the place is conveniently located near little india mustafa shopping centre and has plenty of restaurants right under the hotel
1846,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,family trip the hotel is close to the airport and the mrt thats one of the reasons why we chose hotel boss once we arrived we were greeted by fiona the assistant service manager fiona was very helpful and helped us with some of singapore attractions we are a family of with four children so that was very helpful
1847,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel boss omgosh what a wonderful and friendly place to stay at could not ask for better service from the concierge tan lin chong let us know things that where close by in walking and driving distance recommend a few other places to visit
1848,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,convenient for a short business visit conveniently located only minutes on foot from a metro station on the airport line via a covered walkway everything worked and the staff were very friendly thats about it zero atmosphere and design flair small rooms poor buffet breakfast and the everything worked hides the fact that the room was equipped to the absolute minimum even for a star hotel a star rating is at the limit of generosity but would i stay there again yes for a short business visit
1849,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,stress free stay check in couldve been smoother probably if i didnt choose the trainee welcome drinks would have been a nice touch as it was hot and humid outside good ncov precautions with the temperature check didnt see any hand sanitizers though the one that assisted us with the luggage was up to the task but a bit lost in translation they granted our request for a room in the upper floors we should have included a view of the city their rooms were pitch black and the duvet and temperature control helped get some much needed sleep we were allowed late check out no extra charges the kids enjoyed the pool a bit bathrooms was basic maybe consider having a bidet location was near lavender mrt that was convenient also minutes walk to mustafa center and city square mall where
1850,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel boss experience we had check in here the staff is accomodating even though we had trouble in getting in our room because of the door key the technicians instantly came and fix the problem overall our sleep is good and please ms fiona entertained us in the lobby before checking out the hotel
1851,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,nd visit to my fav hotel in singapore flying in late evening from manila i was looking forward to staying once again in hotel boss near to bugis shopping and easy to reach by public transport i was once again welcomed by ryan yee as if i was a regular customer almost years since my last visit my adrenalin was pumping as i headed to the th floor room what a view this room has a secret sunrise will wake you as the room has unobscured view of the horizon after a copious international breakfast we were met by mr william lew senior guest services manager keeping his promise of a gesture offered for our next trip here promptly arranged for a room upgrade with large room and a balcony which proved to be a great place to watch the citys transformation from day to night lights including an unspoiled view
1852,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,short but wonderful stay excellent hotel very clean and hygienic with wonderful staff n excellent hospitalityfood served was also very nice with all kind of varieties and different cuisineshighly recommended to stay here while you are in singaporefiona liuthe service manager was absolutely wonderful in greeting the guests
1853,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,the most greatest hotel i been seen hotel boss was so clean and so huge the first impression is when i cek in all the stuff was so friendly my favorite stuff is mrs fiona she was really kind and helpful and the swimming pool so clean and big so i can enjoy my trip
1854,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,clean and budget rate hotel my friends and i enjoyed our stay at hotel boss its clean hotel wifi is fast and the cost is affordable we could see people check in and check out of the hotel since the hotel is huge theres rooms in each floor and we stayed on the th floor the only complaint that we have was the breakfast offered never changed i have stayed at a smaller hotel that offered free breakfast and their menu varies everyday many thanks to the assistance of staffs rachel and the front desk staffs natasha and faisal
1855,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,great location near mrt station nice hotel and great position it is near mrt station and busesalso places to eat pool looks great rooms are small but usual for singapore dont bother with room with balcony as you are facing others walls or windows found this very hard as no natural sunlight
1856,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,decent hotel at budget rate hotel is huge with large number of roomsand that is their advantage they always have rooms available at decent price and have tie ups with travel portals like makemytrip etc no much thrills or frills in hotel hotel lobby is always crowded due to so many people checkin almost daily if you are here on romantichonemoon vacations you may be disappointed as i said the rooms are average with no thrills and frills
1857,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,small stopover it was a decent stay in hotel boss nurul from service desk was really helpfuli stayed for a day initially i was not provided the room i booked howeveras soon as i informed them they changed it very courteous staff at the concierge desk as well

1860,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,vacation in sg we enjoyed our stay at this hotel the only comment the foods offered on breakfast at papasan is always the same menu daily i stayed at smaller hotel that offers breakfast and they diff menu tks rachel for explaining of the breakfast offered
1861,Hotel Boss Singapore9,1,tiny pictures were extremely deceiving my boyfriend and i are from the states on vacation and it seems nice a big on the outside but they really squeezed as many rooms into that building as possible almost impossible to walk around the bed because there was no place to store our luggage no closet safe did not work the balcony room that we had the balcony was the size of the room itself not to mention the amount of empty space around the pool went to the pool to lay out and maybe take a dip but there was only lounge chairs for this pool had ample space to add more and it was just empty also no clean towels around the pool area all dirty do not recommend unless ur used to staying in a shoebox
1862,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,mr keval we had a nice stay at hotel boss star for cleaniness and service they have very good indian breakfast we got early checkin which was nice hotel staff racheal helped us identifiying places near by for shopping overall enjoyed stay here

1885,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,upgrade to premier if staying the hotel is situated near the little india part of singapore we stayed for nights at this hotel we took notice of the reviews before we went and upgraded to a premier room so that we had a reasonable space to stay in i can confirm that the cheaper rooms are very small we had very little interaction with the staff but those we sought assistance from were very helpful the th floor room provided spectacular views of singapore we found the room quite nice the furniture was of a good standard and the bathroom was acceptable everything was clean again having read the reviews we stayed well clear of the restaurant and found many cheap local places quite close by with good quality food at very reasonable prices for example we paid singapore dollars for duck in

2033,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,hotel boss review loved our recent stay of nights the guest services manager couldnt have been more helpful we were upgraded to a room with a spectacular view of the city from the th floor the room was serviced daily and although compact was comfortable and clean breakfast daily included in the price at time of booking provided a variety of cuisine and topped up regularly no excuse to go hungry here you can also dine here for dinner if you desire tocha bistro is only metres from the hotel lobby and has good daily deals on alcoholic drinks so you can certainly save a few dollars meals here are also worth trying our favourites being the steak and the salmon there is also a gloria jeans cafe in the lobby where you can sit and watch the people of the world go by the hotel pool
2034,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,awesome stay booking was very easy no issues was getting time to time update hotel near to lavender metro station so many eateries at ground floor we do have indian cuisines very clean hotel only issue was not many varieties at breakfast bus stations just attached to hotel superb view of the city felt as if i had booked hotel in mg road of india though rooms are small they are very clean memorable experience the entire country was wonderful lot to learn from them visit to chinatown for shopping my humble suggestion is to not visit little india you will forget the greatness of singapore if you go there very untidy they are very shabythe environment is just opposite to other parts of singapore overall i had a great experience
2035,Hotel Boss Singapore9,4,new and crowded pros centrally located and close to bars outside a lot of staff new pool and amenitiesgym iron washing machine the restaurant looks good the hotel is connected to a food court by the side which makes it very convenient room was clean and mattress comfortable complimentary parking cons rooms are very small and certain rooms face the walls of other rooms so need to request rooms facing out caters to chinese tours they can be loud at night after coming back from their tour the pool was dirty and not regularly cleaned
2036,Hotel Boss Singapore9,5,everything is just all right the price is not too much and it feels free and comfortable i cannot say perfect but it is really just enough for my need the room service kannika is such a passionate and diligent lady thanks for your care
2037,Hotel Boss Singapore9,3,mixed feelings about our stay at hotel boss we were looking forward to our stay in a superior room at hotel bossthe last stop before home we arrived to a very manic noisy reception area and it was even difficult to hear the receptionist at the service desk the staff were very nice and they had listened to my request and given us a quiet room level away from the lifts when we arrived in the room i couldnt believe that it was a superior room as it was very small in size so i called down to reception where i was informed that all superior rooms were square feet in size and that we were in the right room there is no room to put your suitcases and you can barely walk around the bed the decor is dark grey black and it is very claustrophobic the bathroom though small again was clean and the shower was good
